         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>This Eſſentiall Will is all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Life, cleare, abſtract and pure of it ſelfe; denuded and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothed of all formes of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures bodily or ſpirituall, ſubject to time, or Eternall. Nor is it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by any ſenſe, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Reaſon of Man, but it tranſcends all humane conceit and capacity, inaſmuch as 'tis nothing diſtinct from God himſelfe; and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>For, whereas this Will is in God; it followes that it is God becauſe in God is nothing which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:135667:10"/> thing which were not God, then were there ſome imperfection in him; ſince (without exception) all things are imperfect which are any wayes diſtinct from him. But, ſuch a difference betwixt his Being and his Wil, would leave him very unperfect: for, then hee could not be a ſimple Being and pure Act, which all the Fathers affirme he is: but muſt admit Compoſition at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with many Defects. For, ſo he ſhould have ſomewhat in one part, which in another hee wanted, nor could hee have all in every part. He ſhould poſſeſſe ſome perfection in one part, whereof he were deſtitute in another. And ſo could he not be infinite in all kind of perfection. Yea, he were berea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of his divine Nature, if his Wil were ſeparated from his Being; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſhould then be concluded finite in both: For, where his Will
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:135667:11"/> begun, there ſhould his Being end, and there ſhould his Will end where his Being begun: Both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſhould be concluded finite; If finite, limited; if limited, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; if created, a creature, but not a Creator and God: And againe, becauſe if he were limited, hee muſt needs be limited by ſomewhat. But if any have limited him, then is there ſome greater then he: And conſequently, he cannot be called God, then whom a greater is found.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, if his Will could be ſeparated from his Being, by whom ſhall we imagine ſuch ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to be made? Not by the Creature; for it could not: Not by the Creator, for he would not. The Creature could not; for, there was no ſuch: God would not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in each part of him he loved himſelfe alike. If you ſay they were
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:135667:11"/> ſeparated from the Beginning; you make two Gods from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. If by and by after the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that croſſes Reaſon, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be: ſince the Alone-God inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he is one, he cannot be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated; no more then being one, inaſmuch as he is One, he cannot be divided. And if we may behold the very creatures, as Fire and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whoſe nature is no more than a beame or ſparke of the perfection of this Divine Nature, ſo to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine themſelves in their Unitie and Intireneſſe, as not only not to ſeparate themſelves, but alſo being ſeparated, to reunite and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; How much more then muſt we grant that perfection of Unity to that Nature which natures all theſe? But, let us grant that this Nature can be ſeparated, and that it hath indeede ſo come to paſſe; neither of them can bee God:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:135667:12"/> becauſe neither of them is infinite: for aſmuch as Infinite admits no ſecond.</p>
               <p>But to what purpoſe doe I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſo many reaſons to prove ſo palpable and known a Truth, as that Gods Will is God himſelfe: when the generall Conſent of all the Fathers witneſſeth the ſame? whereupon ſaith Saint <hi>Hilary,</hi> God, who is Light, ſubſiſts not o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Compounds: Nor, who is ſtrength, is held together of weake parts; Nor, who is Light, is made up of obſcure pieces; Nor who is Spirit, is framed of unequalls: All that is in him, is One: So that his Wil w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is in him is himſelfe, and is his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Eſſence. For whatſoever he hath, is every way the ſame that he is. Alſo, the Maſter of the Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The ſimplicity and purity of this Being is ſuch, That there is not any thing in it, which is not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:135667:12"/> it: but hee that hath, and that which is had, are the ſame. Again, the other ſaith, God is not of Compounds as Man, ſo that in him that which is had ſhould bee one thing, and he that hath it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But, all is Life and Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> perfect and Infinite, and not compoſed of parts different, but it ſelfe living through the whole. And <hi>Boetius</hi> upon the ſame ſaith, This is truly One, in whom can be no number, nor other thing in it, but that which is it, neither any thing ſubject to it. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alſo ſaith: In the Subſtance of God, there is not another thing which is not Subſtance, as if there Subſtance were one thing, and accident ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but whatſoever can there be underſtood, is Subſtance. But, theſe things may eaſily be ſaid and leeved; but without a pure heart they can never be ſeene. And in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>another
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:135667:13"/> place. So is had in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of every one of the three, that he which hath is that which hee hath as an unchangeable and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Subſtance. Whereupon <hi>Iſidorus</hi> ſaith: God is ſimple, whether in not loſing what hee hath, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath not one thing which is not hee, and another which is in him. All which Authorities do largely prove that the Will of God is God himſelfe. Even the ſame ſimple and ſole Being with him.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, firſt of all I admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Reader in his ſeeking and contemplating of this Eſſentiall Will, not to have recourſe to any Images, formes, or figures, how ſubtil or ſpritely ſoever. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, leaving them all, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of this Will, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oppoſite thereto; let him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the ſame as in it ſelfe it is, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Being of God far tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:135667:13"/> all created things, and alſo himſelfe. Againe, I deſire that this point be carefully obſerved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the perverſe habit of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding which cannot behold the ſame without ſome form, makes this errour familiar.</p>
               <p>Note alſo, that the two prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Wils are to be drawn and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to this whereof we now treat; And all our actions, outward and inward, bodily and ſpirituall, to be perfected in this Will. 1. <hi>viz.</hi> To wit or that is to ſay, In the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Divine Being, without any backſliding at all. And if this word [Will] ſeeme to ſtumble any man, by raiſing ſome Image, or bringing to minde ſome other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, then may he at his pleaſure let it fall, and hold faſt the word [Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing] or [God,] though indeed not ſo much matter need bee made of the word, as for the ſimplification
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:135667:14"/> of the minde, which in theſe three words, Will, Being, God, diſcerns one and the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>Now, betwixt the Interiour and Eſſentiall Will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s this difference. The one goes before, the other fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. The one is the mean, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the end. The one interiour, the other intimate: the one unitive, the other transformative. The one almoſt eſſentiall, the other altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The one hath certaine Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, yet very ſubtil: the other is pure, naked, and without all forms. In the one the ſoul yet moves ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, in the other ſhee's at perfect Reſt. In the one ſhee's active, in the other paſſive, as receiving the influence and intimate operation of her Bride-groome. And as the Interiour ariſes from the Exterior, ſo the Eſſentiall ariſes out of the Interiour.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. That this Eſſentiall-Will may not be come to, by any meane of Man: with Reaſons aſſuring the ſame.</head>
               <p>HAving now underſtood the Nature, perfection, &amp; height of this Will, it followes that wee preſcribe a mean to attaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. A meane I ſay, without meane. For, 'tis impoſſible that any act, meditation, thinking, aſpiring or working can bee of ſufficient force thereto. No diſcourſe, exerciſe nor Rule, nor any meane to bee here enterpoſed betwixt God and the Soule: But even this onely End without any meane to draw us to it, and raiſe us to the bleſſed viſion and contemplation thereof. And this accordeth with St. <hi>Bon.</hi> who ſaith, that here the higheſt ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of all others, as that of the Trinity by St. <hi>Dyon.</hi> is to bee left:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:135667:15"/> Not, that the ſame is not good and excellent, but becauſe there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more ſupreme apprehenſion in the mind of Man, by which only the higheſt ſpirit is moſt wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully arrived in the Eye of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding muſt be ſtrongly borne downe, becauſe in this Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation 'twill alwaies apprehend that which the affection tends to: whence it is that the greateſt ſtay in our Riſing is the ſtrong-cleaving of the underſtanding to the Deſire, the which muſt netheleſſe bee ſtrongly borne downe, becauſe it conceits either phantaſtically, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcriptibly or in ſome limited manner. And ſtill as much as in this Riſing the underſtanding mixes it ſelfe with the deſire; ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity is there. And againe, as far as the eye of the underſtanding is blindfolded (which will not bee done without hard practiſe and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:)
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:135667:15"/> ſo much is the eye of the deſire in her reach mounted more freely and eminently without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare. And now, the deſire is to forſake all conſideration and love of ſenſibles, alſo the beholding of all Intelligibles, and riſe up pure without admixttion of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to that ſatisfyer of her longing whom in her extent ſhee knowes, that ſhe may bee the more intimately united to him. For, ſince this being is plainely ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, it falls not within the bounds of ſenſe or underſtanding, ſurpaſſing mans capacity it cannot bee comprehended. 'Tis not laid hold on but without us; but, when we bend to any yearnings or acts whatſoever, we remaine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our ſelves. 'Tis not receiv'd but when Man ſuffers: But the Soule producing acts is agent. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is above us, but our owne acts
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:135667:16"/> below us. And therefore ſaith St. <hi>Bon.</hi> wee are here to deſiſt from all naturall incurvation and percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. All thinking in operation how ſpritely ſoever it be, is leſſe then wee. But this being is greater.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>The double looke is quickly gone;</l>
                  <l>The ſingle eye ſtands fixt in one.</l>
               </q>
               <p>He therefore that ſtoops to the Creature, I meane to any Meane, act, or operation perceives not the Creator. That this being may bee received, it onely muſt be minded; but intellectuall diſcourſes glide us away. 'Tis then only compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended when it comprehends and poſſeſſes us, which befalls not ſo long as wee are entangled in our owne thinkings, acts and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings. 'Tis moſt ſimple, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unconceivable to any other but a throughly refined underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. No ſearching knowledge is able to transforme; This is the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:135667:16"/> of Love onely. So often as the ſenſes or underſtanding are diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted about any working, the ſoule is alſo poſted to the ſame object, and muſt needes conſequently bee writhen &amp; bended below her ſelfe, and cannot therefore flye above her ſelfe.</p>
               <p>And thus 'tis evident that in this matter, no help of any Mean of Man is to be ſought: Nor is it once to be thought that this Being may be approached by any Reaſon or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Underſtanding: but contrariwiſe, ſuch diſcourſes &amp; acts are to be utterly abandoned, and all working of the Underſtanding, to be ſtrongly held below, as <hi>Dion</hi> to <hi>Timothy:</hi> See (ſaith hee) that in riſing to myſtical Viſions, <hi>viz.</hi> The Divine Being, thou forſake thy wits by a ſtrong contrition and all workings of thy underſtanding, and all knowables and inviſibles;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:135667:17"/> and ariſe as unknowingly as may be poſſible to the Viſion of him which tranſcends all ſubſtance and knowledge.</p>
               <p>I therefore conclude: That ſince all aſpirings, meditations and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes are here of no uſe, and ſince the wit, judgement, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Man muſt fall before the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Glory; And ſince all acts and workings of the Underſtanding are to be forſaken; I conclude I ſay, that no humane or active Meane may be found to attaine thereto. This Being can no otherwiſe bee comprehended then as it gives it ſelfe to be comprehended: Nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe underſtood then as it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens it ſelfe to be underſtood: Nor be ſeen in any other manner then as it gives it ſelfe to be ſeene: No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It offers it ſelfe to be underſtood, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and enjoyed, when, how, and by whom it luſteth. But our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall powers are unuſefull and good for nothing.</p>

In the one is found a certaine ſenſible Devotion flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the knowing powers: But in the other (eſpecially in the Beginning) ſhee mounts above al, both wit and underſtanding; And
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:135667:20"/> there is God ſeene, and by naked love held and enjoyed. Though for all this, in concluſion theſe two wayes fall into one, leade to the ſame end, and are taſted in the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>Let every one therefore take to himſelfe which of theſe 2 Meanes he findes allotted him; and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle himſelfe in both at once: of which the ſecond is perfecter in the Act Annihilation.</p>

And therefore ſince it ſeems to do them ſo much good, they forſake not the uſe thereof, though in their hearts they well know that thoſe ſame be great Impediments in this Life, as alſo all the other defects and failings which uſually we meet: with in our Comtemplation and Union, from which they bee never quite freed, how ſubtilly ſoever the ſame have winded in and hid themſelves.</p>
               <p>That therefore we may returne to our purpoſe, the ſoul how high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoever inlightned and ſeated in lofty contemplation, yet ſtraight diſcovers
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:135667:23"/> here ſome wandrings and imperfections exceeding ſecret; which blown away, ſhee followes her Bridegroomes Lure with a ſtronger Mount and ſwifter Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, purſuing the threed of the Divine Wil before drawn into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe in the firſt and ſecond part more eſſentially. And theſe imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections be three.</p>
               <p>The firſt is a too much boy ling of the deſires and fervours in the Soule, which ſavours too much of Action, &amp; diſturbs the ſweet peace and quiet Reſt of her Bridegroome in her, and croſſes his ſole, ful, and perfect working and abſolute ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty over her, where-through ſhee neither lets her ſelfe be perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly illuminate, nor riſes to the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie kiſſes and chaſte embraces of her Lover, but remains as it were wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then down into her ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is a certain hidden
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:135667:23"/> thin, and unknowne Image of the Divine Will which the Soule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, vailing her from ſeeing it eſſentially.</p>
               <p>The third is that ſhee does not inſtantly behold her Bridegroome as really preſent, and more-preſent then her ſelf, and more within her then her ſelfe, and more ſhee then her ſelfe; but as one reſiant in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, or ſome other-where more remote from her then ſhe from her ſelfe: whence it was that neither ſo lively faith, nor ſo firme hope, nor ſo ardent Love, nor ſo raviſhing entercourſes paſt betweene them as otherwiſe ſhould befall. Yet, look I not that ſhe ſhould perfectly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern all theſe failings till ſhee have reached the following degrees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they can hardly be perceived till they be corrected by the Divine Spirit. And theſe three Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doe directly oppoſe the three
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:135667:24"/> following points and perfections, handled in the three next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And therefore we will treate of them al together, that the one may remedie the other.</p>

               <head>The Second Point. CHAP. 5. Of the too much Boyling of the Deſires, and of the flowing of the ſame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires into God. Where is ſhewed a ſimple and eſſentiall riſe of the Minde.</head>
               <p>TIs not my purpoſe by this too much boyling of the Deſires, to reprove thoſe ſacred Deſires which in God are found in his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſo far forth as they be orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red aright, but ſo far as they are ill ordered, or have ſome complement annexed, which hinders their ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; perfect conſummation, Deifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, free entry, ſpentneſſe and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:135667:24"/> dying in God. This hinderance is no other but the too much boyling of them. 1. Active. Active I ſay (excluding the paſſive) which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtill, without noiſe, without Acts, profound and godlike:) But the Active on the other ſide, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, unconſtant, ſuperficiall, too much ſmelling of Man, and of the nature and operation of Man. And this twofold ſpecies of the Deſires may fitly be reſembled to two wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whereof the one is muddy, bubling and full of murmur; yet but ſhallow: the other cleare, ſmooth, and ſtill, yet extream deep. Therefore this boyling of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires (though good in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning) is here to be rejected. Not that good deſires are to be refuſed, but their Imperfections: Not that we ſhould forſake them, but perfect them, nor yet loſe them, but refine and fulfill them in God. For, as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:135667:25"/> ſeed is not loſt becauſe caſt in his place, but changed and multiplied, as we ſee in a graine of corne, that it periſheth not though thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ground, but is changed and encreaſed: So, neither doe good Deſires periſh when they be termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in God, but are purified, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, and perfected. And as the grain of corne, unleſſe it firſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and dye, bringeth not forth Increaſe; So neither doe good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires ever take their effects. <hi>i.</hi> Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Transformation, unleſſe they firſt be exhauſted, or fal ſound aſleep in God. Whence is that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Saviour: Except a grain of corn falling into the earth, dye, <hi>it bringeth no fruit;</hi> But if it dye, <hi>it bringeth much fruit.</hi> As alſo at firſt the graiue is needfull, ſo in the end it muſt needs corrupt, that wheate may grow up.</p>
               <p>'Tis thus with good Deſires and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:135667:25"/> their Annihillation, that they may obtaine their Union with God. But as in this corruption, the grain is improperly ſaid to be corrupted, but rather to be altered or changed into Corne; So alſo wee ſay im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly that theſe good Deſires are nothing; but rather changed and transformed into Union. Howbeit, as the graine is never at length returned the ſame, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines for ever transformed or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into Corne as into his effect and laſt end and perfection: So neither are theſe good Deſires ever after to be begun again, but to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere transformed into Union as into their effect and crowne of compleatneſſe. Laſtly, as the grain is not to be caſt in every earth, nor at al times, but very carefully, both commodiouſneſſe of place and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſeaſon is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; In like manner, good deſires
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:135667:26"/> are not every where to be annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, but in God alone: Nor yet in every exerciſe, but only in that of the Union: Nor yet ſodainly in the beginning, but in the time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted for that purpoſe, which is even after the Exerciſe of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Life well drawn into practiſe is accompliſht. Where plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares how much they are blinded that thinke they muſt alway be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and never reſt from ſuch fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Acts &amp; Yearnings; And much more they that in ſuch manner of working imagine the true Union to be placed, and condemn the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary for faulty, and ſtilneſſe for nothing worth; which is flat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the doctrine of <hi>Dionyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> before cited Chap. 2. who alſo ſaith in another place, That our Intellectuall workings muſt be cut off, that we may ſend in our ſelves ſo much as may be into the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſentiall
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:135667:26"/> Shine. But the Soul ſhal cure this failing and impediment in her Journey and found Union, by emptying of her fervours into God; Not that ſhe muſt work any thing, but onely ſuffer ſuch wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
               <p>The Emptying here of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Deſires into God, is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing of the practicke Love with the fruitive; or a finall reſt and full ſatisfaction of the deſires in God, where the Deſire is ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up, and paſſes into poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This word emptying inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates two things. 1. Death and Life: or Loſſe and Gaine: Becauſe inaſmuch as the Deſire flowes out of the Soule, 'tis extinct and dies; but inaſmuch as 'tis ended in God, it receives more Increaſe, and lives more then ever before. Therefore I liſted not uſe the word Annihilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if they were made nothing in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:135667:27"/> God; But I ſaid Emptying of the Deſires into God, becauſe they are preſerved in him. Nor did I call it a preſervation of the Deſires, but an Emptying; Intimating thereby that they are not afterward felt in the ſoule, for that they be ſublime, &amp; alſo becauſe of the lively &amp; ſweet working of God in the ſoule, who thus transformes the Deſire into the thing deſired.</p>
               <p>Alſo, this change contains three things. A cleer Manifeſtation of the thing deſired; A full ſatisfaction of the Deſires, and a Reſt of the ſame.</p>
               <p>For the firſt; this Manifeſtation of the thing deſired, which is God, comes not all at once, but ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively and as it were by ſteps accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Increaſe of our Love. For, firſt God abideth in the Soul, but ſhee knows him not. Then he declares himſelfe to her; but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely: Then more clearly, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:135667:27"/> as it were in full Noon-day; All which ſteppes are expreſt by the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles.</hi> For, firſt 'tis plaine by theſe words, <hi>I ſought him, but found him not:</hi> where wee may ſee two things: One, that God was in her; the other, Shee knew him not. Whereof the firſt is apparent in the words <hi>[I ſought;]</hi> ſince 'tis wel known, and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> affirmes ſhee ſought him no where without herſelfe, neither could ſhe. The other, That ſhee knew not that he was in her, is cleare in the words following; <hi>I found him not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond ſtep of this Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation is when God declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be in the ſoule; yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely, and more by certain effects ſuch as fervent deſires and holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations, then by any eſſentiall knowledge. The which appears in theſe words of the Bride, <hi>I caught him,</hi> Nor <hi>will I let him goe.</hi> For in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:135667:28"/> ſaying <hi>I caught him,</hi> ſhee ſhews ſhee doubted not but ſhe had him: Yet in adding [Till I bring] &amp;c. ſhee intimates that poſſeſſion was not ſure enough; inſinuating that her Deſires were not yet filled with the Beholding end enjoying of him; but that ſhould be when ſhee had brought him into her Mothers houſe. And this is when the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom doth not only preſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as a Lord, but even as a very Bridegroome; not only by whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering Inſpirations, but alſo by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Touches; trayning the Soule not as a Tutor by Rules, but as an affianc't Lover by amorous allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Yet, ſince this Enjoyance and Viſion of her Deareſt, hath not yet reacht the top of her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, ſhe ceaſes not to cry to him; Who ſhal give me thee my brother, ſucking the Duggs of my Mother, that I may finde thee abroad and kiſſe thee?</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:135667:28"/>
               <p>The which at length ſhe attains to in the third ſtep of this Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, much cleerer and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the former, and which is then aſcended when as the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome drawes ſo neere his Bride that ſhee ſees his very ſhadow, even his God-like Image, whereunder ſhe curiouſly ſurveyes him, keepes company with, and muſes on him, chuſing there to ſet up her Reſt, ſaying, <hi>I ſate under the ſhadow of him whom I loved.</hi> There ſhe hears him, There ſhe adores him, There ſhee entertains his familiar parleyes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous diſcourſes, and ſugred ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; There ſhee receives the promiſes of Life, the token of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and full aſſurance of ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing of the Wedding; There ſhee imboſoms and kiſſes him; There ſhe gets the Jewels, Chains, and Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Garments.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, there ſhe's inabled to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:135667:29"/> ſtand the Eſſential &amp; ſpritely enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of her Bridegroome, under whoſe ſhadow ſhee ſits till the day dawn, and the ſhadows decline. Yea even till the Wedding day and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall Viſion, when that vaile or ſhadow whereunder ſhe ſaw him, ſhall vaniſh and paſſe away. For which Wedding and happy Viſion day ſhee waites with deepe ſighes, hanging on him with undenyable Importunity: <hi>Show mee thou whom my ſoule loves where thou lyeſt in the Noone-day: ô my Joy! ô Center of my Heart! where and how I ſhall find thee ô my God,</hi> naked without vaile, without Image, ſhadow, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity.</p>
               <p>Which lowly deſire, her infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Lover not able to withſtand, ſtrips himſelf before her according to her wiſhes, letting her ſee him in a manner not only unutterable, but alſo incomprehenſible.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:135667:29"/>
               <p>And this makes up the fourth ſtep which againe is ſo much emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenter then all the reſt, that not only they that have never proved cannot conceive it but even others that ſometimes have taſted it, are not able to comprehend the Luſtre thereof, ſince it tranſcends all I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination, working of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, wit, reaſon and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Man, becauſe 'tis done without Man. For, as the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome humbles himſelfe below himſelfe: So, his Bride rebounds herſelfe above herſelfe, mutually meeting to celebrate the Marriage. In this ſtep ſhe ſings, <hi>I turned to my Beloved, and he to me,</hi> that ſhe might declare their Actuall Union and their Mutuall enjoyance of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Spirit and Trueth. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in another expreſſion thereof ſhee ſaith, <hi>My Beloved ſhall lodge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:135667:36"/> it conſumes all her impurities. And laſtly, ſo ſtrict is this Union, that ſhee is all exhauſted in God, in whom all her Imperfections be drown'd, loſt, and brought to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And by the ſame worke ſhee gets a new Light, and a far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Capacity then ever ſhe had triall of, and is thereby enabled to worke extatically and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, without and above her ſelfe, and all her naturall and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Underſtanding, wherein ſtands the ſecond effect of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloathing, Illumination: For, here ſhe is made drunk and giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with ſuch abundance of Light, that ſhee is covered therewith as with a garment, transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and made one with the Light it ſelfe. For, ſince in this moſt ſtrict union, God the fountaine and Well-ſpring of this univerſall inacceſſible Light is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:135667:37"/> inward, and nigh to the ſoule then ſhee to her ſelfe, and that in this Lovely union no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of the Bridegroom uſefull for her to know is kept from her. It followes, that this myſtery full of all joy and raviſhment is revealed to her, that her Bridegroome, the Eternall God is found within her. Him ſhe beholds in her ſelfe, after her hearts deſire, without vaile or Image, ſeeing him as at full noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, how he reſts within her, as in his owne Tabernacle, exerciſing a ſweet and familiar operation within her. And whilſt ſhee ſees, taſtes, and proves how he is nearer to her then her ſelfe; and how ſhe is more hee then ſhee is her ſelfe; and that ſhe poſſeſſes him not as ſomething, nor as her ſelfe, but more then all things, and more then her ſelfe. According to this Light ſhee ſo demeanes her ſelfe,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:135667:37"/> that all her Joy, Life, Will, Love and Sight are much rather in him then in her ſelfe; and that becauſe ſhe knowes him farre more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and worthy then her ſelfe, and hath found him more delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſweet then her ſelfe. And laſtly, ſees him more faire and glorious then her ſelf. And again, having learned by proofe that he is all things, and her ſelfe nothing, and that in him is all beauty, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and pleaſure, in her ſelfe nothing but bitterneſſe of evill: In him alone ſhe ſtayes, in him ſhe dwells, in him ſhe lives, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all in her ſelfe. Whence it followes that ſhee is all in God, all to God, all for God, and all God; but nothing in her ſelfe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to her ſelfe, nothing for her ſelfe, and nothing her ſelfe: She all is converſant in the Divine Will, Spirit, Light, and Power; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:135667:38"/> in her owne Spirit, Will, Light, and owne or naturall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. In that Power, in that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in that Light with an unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able eye ſhee beholdeth this Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Will, or Divine Being, as 'tis ſaid, <hi>In thy Light ſhall wee ſee Light:</hi> Here ſhe diſcovers hidden and unſearchable ſecrets: Here lies her way open to Light, unacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: Here ſhe unfolds unutterable Myſteries: Here ſhe viewes won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: Here ſhe ſwims in endleſſe joyes. For, being united with God, none of theſe myſteries, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets and wonders can bee kept from her. For, ſince God hath ſhewed her himſelfe, how ſhall he hide any needfull ſecret from her? And now having found within her ſelfe, the fountaine of all ſweetneſſe, and the Well-ſpring of all Pleaſures, Delights, and Joyes, how ſhall ſhe but be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

For, he that dwells in Love, dwels in God, and God in him. Where the ſoul followes her Bridegroom ſo light and ſwift, ſo ſtrong and eager, and runs after him with ſuch earneſtnes, thirſt, and unſatiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, clinging to him with a full Inclination of love and bond un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looſable, that they be as the body and the ſhadow, ſhe following the <hi>Lamo</hi> whitherſoever he goes, whoſe ſavour, ſweetneſſe, and lovelineſſe have ſo enamoured, raviſht, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly ſtole her away, that in the depth of her heart ſhe conceives a horror of herſelf, utterly abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:135667:39"/> all her own thoughts of her ſelf, and all ſenſe of ſweetnes from her ſelfe, that ſhe may ſuck in the ſweetneſſe of this ſubſtance, that ſhe may eternally caſt her ſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into, and loſe her ſelfe there, never to be found againe, reſting even there, &amp; that for the naked love of the ſame Being. Whence it is that ſhe deadly hates all whatſoever brings therwith the leaſt feeling of delight in her ſelfe, or caſts in ſo much as a thought of her ſelfe, or that ſayes ſhee's one, and her Bridegroome another; In whom ſhe ſo expoſes her ſelfe to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, waſted, and annihilated, together with all created things, that in compariſon thereof ſhee diſdaines to live. Here ſhe opens her ſelfe, and entertaines this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not as a veſſell receives what it holds, but as the Moon does the ſhine of the Sun. Here ſhe throwes
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:135667:40"/> abroad her white and Lilly armes, to fold and cloſe-inchaine her Lover, but much cloſer is ſhee embrac't and inchained by him. Here ſhe enlarges all the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of her Minde to draw in this Infinite, but on the other ſide ſhe feeles her ſelfe moſt raviſhingly ſwallowed up in it. Nor can ſhe finde what to doe to rebound the aſſault and conqueſt of this Love, but only yeeld over her ſelfe for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in a naked, harmleſſe, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting converſion and faſt clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to God, in whom ſhe abide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For, as on her part the ſoule with all her powers lyes open to God, ſo alſo on his part God with all his Joys everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infuſes himſelfe into her; And the more innocently ſhe turnes to him, the more overflowingly hee poures himſelfe into her. And on the other ſide the more overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he infuſes himſelfe into her, the more inflamedly ſhe turnes to him: ſo that by an unexpreſſible entercourſe of reciprocall Love, they mutually cut and intwine themſelves, for ever paſſing away the poſſeſſion of themſelves to each other. Hence then, and from this Virgin-like and conſtant turning to God proceeds this habite of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or continuall preſence of the divine Being.</p>

               <p>THe ſecond Meane is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from Senſe then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:135667:43"/> and more Supernaturall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and perfect: For, whereas the other works ſo nakedly and above Nature, only (or at leaſt chiefly) when the ſoul is taken up without her ſelfe by force of the Actual pul of the Divine Will; this workes alſo, when that pull is not much actuall, but only virtuall. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mean is ſpritely naked and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Nature when the ſoule is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and uncloathed. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues alſo naked and ſupernatural when one is employed in Outer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, tangled in formes, and cumbred with buſineſſe, changing the outward into inward, bodily into ſpirituall, and naturall into ſupernaturall by help of this Mean. Though indeed the other rightly conceived and duely practiſed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhes the ſame thing, but not in open view, as ſhall be ſeen.</p>
               <p>But here I pray that this Meane
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:135667:44"/> be well underſtood. For it pertains oneIy to thoſe that bee throughly inlightned, and are able to ſtand it.</p>
               <p>Now, this Meane ſhall be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but the Beginning and the ending: Even this Divine will which is never to be left. And this point ſhal be ſo cleared by the othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For the firſt point. This Will ſhall ſhew and confirme to us that nothing is but it: And that it ſhall doe eaſily, if we conſider the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof. For, ſince it is God himſelfe, it followes that nothing is but it: And that it ſhall doe eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainly if we conſider the nature of it. It is God himſelfe, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Nothing is but it. And that this Will is God himſelf, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the firſt Chapter. But, that nothing is but it alone, remaines now to bee proved. The which thing is ſo known and unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that both Reaſon, Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, general conſent of all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as alſo the holy Scriptures, and examples abundantly witneſſe the ſame.</p>

               <p>Examples and Types hereof are ſhewed us in the apprehending of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:135667:46"/> our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Where hee had no ſooner uttered <hi>[I am,]</hi> but all his enemies fell backe to the ground; to teach us that when the Divine Being rouſes it ſelfe, all other Beings fall downe, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and be no more.</p>
               <p>Where five things are remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in that Backfal. Firſt, That they could not goe forwards. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that when God claimes his Prerogative of Infinite Being, our Being hurried and puft up with pride can ſtirre no further. Secondly, they were not onely not able to go forwards, but were compell'd to fall backwards: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring to us that when once wee know the Truth, our being can not onely no more preſſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but muſt alſo of neceſſity fall backwards: Declaring to us that when once wee know th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Truth: For, they fell not on thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:135667:46"/> face, but backwards, as falſhood not onely comes not to Truth, but alſo flies and gives backe from it, as wax from the face of the Fire. Thirdly, they not onely fell back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but they fell to the ground: ſhewing that the divine Being, not onely forces our proud Being to ſhrinke backe, but to fall downe to the very ground, <hi>i.</hi> into Not being, and All to nothing. Fourthly, Note that they were enemies, as are alſo all they that through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence, will arrogate to themſelves any thing of the divine Being. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they were not onely enemies, but they ſtrove to apprehend, bind, and manacle him, to deprive him of his power and ſtrength, and then calling all the world to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe him not to be God, to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him with a bloudy death. All which Treaſons are ſpiritually committed by thoſe that aſcribe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:135667:47"/> any being to themſelves in preſence of the Divine Being. If any now demand, What then is the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? I anſwer, 'tis no more but a meere dependance upon God. If againe you aske, What is this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance? I anſwer, 'Tis ſuch as cannot well bee expreſt in words: yet by a ſimilitude we may come to ſome Notion thereof. So then is the Creature to God, as the Beame to the Sun, or heat to the Fire. For, as the Beame and heat doe ſo abſolutely owe themſelves to their productive Cauſes, as that without their perpetuall ſuſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and communicating, they cannot ſubſiſt: Even, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſo omnimodous is the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures depending on God, that without his continuall preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they cannot endure. And as the Beam and Heat are wholly to have relation to their Cauſes, the Beam
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:135667:47"/> to the Sun, the Heat to the Fire, according to that Maxime. All be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuch by participation is to have relation to Being, ſuch by eſſence: So, are the Creatures to be fully reduc'd to the Creator. And conſequently, as whatſoever is in the Beame and Heate ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, is no other then Sunne and Fire it ſelfe: ſo is there nothing in the Creature which is not the Creator himſelfe. And therefore as the Sun is no ſooner hid, but the Beames ceaſe to be; So, if God hide himſelfe, and withdraw his hand from the Creatures, they ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly returne to their Nothing. But, as the Beam and Heat though they containe nothing which is not Sun and Fire; yet lookt upon eſſentially as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they are not Sun and Fire, but onely a certaine dependent or a ſparke of thoſe: Right ſo the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:135667:48"/> Creature, though all it conſiſts of, is God: yet conſidered in the own proper Nature, it is not God. If you ſay; that ſince the Creature depends upon God, 'tis conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſomewhat: I anſwer, that it is; and yet is nothing, juſt as the Beame and Heat. For, as if one looke on the Beame without the Sunne, or the Heat, or the Heate, not ſeeing the fire, they be; But, if he looke on the Sunne it ſelfe, and the fire it ſelfe, hee findes no Beame nor Heate any more, but whatſoever is there then is Sunne and fire: So, if you imagine the Creature without an eye on the Creator, it is; but if you behold the Creator, then the Creature ceaſes to be. And as the Sun drawes bac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to himſelfe all his Beames as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Raies ſent out from him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calls them to their fount, (his ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious light) ſucks them up, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:135667:48"/> nothings them: Even ſo the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor aſcribes and ownes the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to himſelfe, as to the Center and Head, and in his Infinity an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilates and nothings the ſame. Loe there! how the Creature Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in it ſelf is ſomewhat: but in the boundleſneſſe of God, and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, is nothing: in reſpect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it ceaſes to bee. Becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we here ſeek God, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach his Infinite Being, the creature is not to be ſtuck at as any thing: but as loſt in this bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Ocean. And thus you ſee how God is All things, and that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is but he; which makes ſure the firſt point, <hi>Theory.</hi> Now to the ſecond point, <hi>Practiſe.</hi>

               <p>Now that this ſame may bee wrought in us by this Eſſential wil; a certaine diſpoſedneſſe thereto is required on our part, not remote, as is that of the Active life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we did good, and rejected evill, in the object of the exteriour will, becauſe God ſo willeth; but a meer diſpoſedneſſe, ſuch as is required in this life, wherein wee doe the

               <head>CHAP. X. Of the Impediments of this Annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And of the moſt ſecret and cloſe Imperfections of Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</head>
               <p>THe firſt ſecret and unknowne Imperfection of this Life Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminent, is conteſting or wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt ſuperfluous Cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Diſtractions; The Reaſon is, becauſe by ſuch Conteſting, thoſe thoughts are glewed ſtronger and faſter in the Minde: For, in as much as the Will which purſues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing with Love or Hatred,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:135667:53"/> awakes the Underſtanding to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it, and the Memory to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord it; It followes, that the more eagerly the Will is animated and beſtirres it ſelfe againſt ſuch Thoughts, the more the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding conceives them, renewes them in the Memory, and imprints them in the Mind. 'Tis not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the right way to fret or wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle againſt ſuch Thoughts and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions. Another reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the more a man ſo conteſts, the more Motions and Acts are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got in the ſoule, and ſo ſhe is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and further from this Death and Annihilation, after this our Rule, becauſe the more one acts, the more he is.</p>
               <p>The Cure of this Imperfection is the Contrary; <hi>i.</hi> a deſpiſing of ſuch Thoughts and Diſtractions, by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilating himſelfe in this Abyſſe of Light and Life. Wherein him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:135667:53"/> falling to nothing, thoſe thoughts alſo do conſequently va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. All that Infinite which anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilates the Man, drownes alſo his Diſtractions: Nor need he care whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee feele or not feele ſuch Thoughts, but even abide ſtable and fixt in his Nothing, and reſign the Battel to his All, <hi>i.</hi> to this Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall Will his God. And this way of proceeding (I ſay not of fighting) is to be continued againſt all kinde of Temptations in this Life Supereminent.</p>
               <p>Another Imperfection is to tye the Minde to ſome particular exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, counting it needfull to end ſuch or ſuch a thing, before it ſuffer it ſelfe to be raiſed higher. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe thereby he makes that bond bring both him and that excerciſe in ſubjection thereto. And thus hee lets goe his freedome, ſo that he cannot lay downe himſelfe

               <p>A ſixth Imperfection in this Life Supereminent is, to lift up the Minde, deſiring to finde God in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place, and in a higher man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then in our ſelves. For, 'tis a blindneſſe in the ſoule not to know that ſhe is already there where ſhee deſires to be, even in God, and God in her: Whereas the ſoule cleared of this obſcurity, ſees her ſelfe to be, and live in God more then in her ſelfe, and that ſhee is more his then her owne. <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſuch
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:135667:59"/> an act of lifting up the Minde the Soule is to ceaſe from, and reſting in her own Nothing, and conſtant in this All, continually to behold and embrace the ſame as with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire already obtained.</p>

Let not therefore the devout reader forget in theſe Imperfections as well paſt as following, of what thing and manner of Life we ſpeak, <hi>i.</hi> of Contemplation in the Life Supereminent.</p>
               <p>An eighth Adverſary to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of this Life is, to ſeeke God otherwiſe then by ſimple Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. For, ſuch a ſeeking preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes abſence; ſince none ſeekes what hee knowes hee has already. And this Contemplation preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the preſence of God. Yet this Imperfection ariſes from want of Faith: whilſt we beleeve not that we have not what wee ſeek. Nor doth this Imperfection onely proceede from
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:135667:60"/> ſome darknes, but it alſo produceth others, cauſing that not to be found which is ſought. All things have their time (ſaith the Wiſe man:) A time to ſeeke, a time to finde, a time to ſow, a time to reape. And, as he that alway ſowes and plowes can never reape; ſo he that ſhould alway ſeeke God by practick Life, ſhall never enjoy him by fruitive For, if the Cauſes be ill directed, they not only take not their effects, but doe alſo produce the Contrary. As, alway to ſow, not only ſtayes Corne from comming up, but alſo begets barrenneſſe. The ſame befals in this ſeeking of God.</p>
               <p>To remedy this Imperfection; God is here to be found and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by loſſe and Annihilation of our ſelves in ſimple Remembrance of him.</p>
               <p>And the ninth Imperfection is, here to long for God as one abſent,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:135667:60"/> and that for reaſons not unlike the former. For, what is in prayer and deſire, is not alſo in poſſeſſion. But, here God gives himſelfe to be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt, and is not therefore to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as abſent, but en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oyed as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. This Deſire alſo hath Act, hindering compleat Annihilation.</p>
               <p>A tenth Imperfection is, to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to God with an Imaginary Thinking: both, becauſe that ſhould not be, and alſo becauſe it cannot be. It ſhould not be; for ſuch an Act with ſtands Annihilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It cannot be, becauſe God is wholly Supernaturall, &amp;c. but our thinking is Naturall. God is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and above us: Our Thinking leſſe, and below us. God therefore is to bee beheld, but not to be thought on Imaginarily.</p>
               <p>There is alſo an Imperfection in eaſting a Looke as it were upon God, ſomewhat more then a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:135667:61"/> Remembrance of him, as if hee were in ſome other place, and not in the Soule, and the Soule in him, as a fiſh in the Sea, or a bird in the Fire. And therefore the ſouls Look ought to be as ſuffering, ſhe ever remaining in her Nothing, <hi>i.</hi> It ſhould be extracted by this Divine Glory, not from her ſelfe. For, as the Sunne darts his rayes into any tranſparent Body, as water, glaſſe, or cryſtal, from thence provoking towards himſelfe a certaine reflex Light. So, God who deſcends his Beames and ſight into the ſoule, doth alſo rebound from her a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>uall aſpect towards himſelfe. But as that reflected Light is not the waters, but the Suns which pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and inluſtring the ſame, is fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed towards the Sun himſelfe; So, the Light of this Eye-ſight is not the ſoules but Gods: And being Spirit, Life and Light, it through-breakes
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:135667:61"/> the ſoule, ſublimes her, and ſo is reflected on God, fixing the ſoul therewith, which is thus made one with God, as himſelfe ſaith. <hi>The Word which goeth out of my mouth ſhall not return empty to me, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I will, it ſhall a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:135667:62"/>
               <p>And laſtly, none of the leaſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections is a too buſie obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of theſe &amp; ſuch other Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which now poſſeſſes the ſoul, and makes her Active, becauſe they either are, or at leaſt containe ſome Action.</p>
               <p>Wherefore in checking them, 'tis faulty to be too much intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but only to doe it quicke with a twinkle of the eye, ſwift as Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>All theſe Imperfections therefore contend againſt Annihilation. Not that ſo many points doe draw any Multiplicity upon this Exerciſe: For, how many ſoever the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections be, yet are they all done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by one only point and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For, as they all ſpring from one head [To be] ſo are they al va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht by the contrary [Not to be] For, as all Imperfections aſſemble where Man is ſomewhat; ſo doe al
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:135667:62"/> perfections flouriſh where hee ends to be: For, then God onely lives and reignes.</p>
               <p>And if to any theſe ſeeme no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, 'tis becauſe they lye too cloſe. If any thinke them ſmal, 'tis becauſe the great diſadvantage they bring, is unknown. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if any take them for perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, 'tis even becauſe they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not what exerciſe wee have in hand, which is Contemplation in the Life Supereminent: where (ſaith <hi>Bon.)</hi> all Intellectuall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings are eſteemed blots and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances; For, as 'tis high, ſo it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires rules anſwerable to that height.

               <head>CHAP. XI. Of a two-fold kinde of Annihilation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Their difference. And how they make to a two-fold Love.</head>
               <p>BEcauſe this laſt Chapter ſhews Annihilation only by ceaſing from all acts, vaniſhing of Images, doing nothing, and reſt from all Motion in God: And foraſmuch as nathleſſe 'tis required that ſome times ſuch Acts and workings muſt be uſed, ſuch Images admitted, and that we muſt have ſuch Motions in renewing of workings, in Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in ſtudies, preaching, practiſe of the paſſion, &amp;c. it therefore ſtands us upon, to point out a way to annihilate ſuch acts, as alſo to ſhew the practiſe thereof. For, though we have ſhewed, that thoſe Acts as well as all other things, are nothing, and though a Man
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:135667:63"/> have the knowledge of this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing &amp; of their Annihilation, yet may he want the practiſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both theſe points are equally neceſſary in this matter, (as wee ſaid before) that God alone may be ſeen alwayes, who is the end of this Annihilation.</p>
               <p>But now to practiſe this thing duely: Firſt, I admoniſh the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to pluck up his ſpirits here, that they may worke more ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally, and (I ſay not, further from ſenſe then before, but) flat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereto. For, where before he annihilated them when they were abſent, here he muſt alſo annihilate them preſent.</p>
               <p>Which to doe, and that this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation may bee cleare and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, we will here diſtinguiſh it into. Active and Paſſive. Paſſive is, when the man himſelfe, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things are caſt aſleep, vainly,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:135667:64"/> und be made nothing. I call it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, becauſe 'tis onely ſuffered: The Imperfections whereof wee have blowne away in the former Chapter.</p>
               <p>The Active Annihilation is when the Man himſelfe, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things are annihilated not onely ſufferingly, as in the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, but doingly, I meane by Light in the Underſtanding, as well na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, as ſupernaturall: wherein he ſees and moſt infallibly knowes that all thoſe things are nothing, and reſts upon this knowledge in deſpight of feeling. The one of theſe Annihilations lives when all Image and feeling of the Creatures is gone. The other continues alſo firme and ſure, even whilſt they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, after ſenſe, and yet by means of this light are ſeene to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The one conſiſts in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, drawne from Experience,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:135667:64"/> when a man ſees himſelfe brought to nothing, as 'tis ſaid, <hi>I am brought to nothing.</hi> The other conſiſts in Knowledge true indeed, yet not ſeeming ſo after ſenſe, but after underſtanding. Of theſe two the Active is more perfect for two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; Strength and Duration. For ſtrength, becauſe together with it ſelfe, it nothings all other things: Not onely when it ſailes with the actuall blaſt and breath of this Will or Divine Being; but even then alſo when the ſoule feels drought and barrenneſſe; annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating all things felt, as well as thoſe which be gone and vaniſht. The which point requires carefull Attention. For, thus it annihilates as well all things that remain af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter feeling, as alſo that ſame which annihilates them, <hi>i.</hi> the owne Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Knowledge, with all manner of working thereof.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:135667:65"/> Not enduring that any thing whatſoever, Image nor feeling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, but only God. For ſtrength alſo, becauſe neither a multitude of outward affaires, nor abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of inward or intellectuall workings can hinder this Annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or diſtract the man himſelf. For ſtrength againe; Becauſe 'tis not onely farre diſtant from ſenſe, but flat contrary thereto; So that it annihilates things not onely when the minde in abſtractions rides above them; but even then when 'tis converſant among them, looking on them as if it looked not: whence neceſſarily ariſes Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which is the ſecond perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Active Annihilation. And both theſe perfections are not ſo perfectly found in the Paſſive An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation, which ſtayes alwayes the Actuall Lure of God. There be many that both know and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:135667:65"/> the Paſſive, but few the Active. And ſo, they no ſooner faſten on any worke bodily or ſpirituall, but they eaſily ſinke, fall downe, and become divided, and ſo live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in languiſhing and unſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe of ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Annihilations make to a two-fold Love, fruitive, and practick, whereon ſtands the whole ſpirituall Life. The Paſſive tends to the Fruitive Love, the Active to the Practick. For in as much as theſe two Loves are never perfect, till in the Practick love wee can enjoy God even as in the Fruitive; 'Tis therefore expedient that this Active Annihilation mediate to annihilate the Acts of this Practick Love, which otherwiſe might hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that enjoying, and raiſe ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny middle walls between God and the ſoule. As therefore the Paſſive Annihilation nothings all things
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:135667:66"/> by deading all our feeling of them, and tranſchanging them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to enjoying Love: So, the Active annihilates them alſo ſtill remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, (though in ſenſe wee feele them) transforming them into fruitive Love: So that the Love, which without this Active Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation were meerly Practick, may thus become fruitive. And ſo by this Active Annihilation we ſhall continually enjoy God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we worke and produce Acts or no. But, as the ſame falls not under ſenſe, but is onely ſpirituall and ſupernaturall: So the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to which it leads us is not perceived in our feeling, but in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and tranſcends nature.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII. That this Active Annihilation conſiſts in equalling the Paſſive. The pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of it in Light and Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</head>
               <p>THE Perfection of this Active Annihilation conſiſts in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualling the Paſſive, in a Death of all things, and in a Paſſive Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation, after the ſpirit, though not after feeling. And the ſigne ſhewing it to be abſolutely perfect, is when it annihilates the things which we perceive by ſenſe as veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as if wee perceiv'd them not: And even in the face of all theſe ſenſibles brings as Invincible faith, peace, and union with God, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe things which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready loſt and nothing. For, thus a man ſeeing, ſees not, when hee holds not the ſame Formes in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:135667:67"/> and Debatement. And ſo he lives in a perpetuall Death, and dyes in an eternall Life, buried in Triumph of Conqueſt, like that valiant Champion <hi>Eleazar,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomb'd in the glory of his victory, when cruſht with the fall of the Beaſt he ended his dayes. For, this Beaſt which hee ſlew is the whole ſinſible world, which when wee kill and bring to nothing, we alſo ſlay and annihilate our ſelves; and ſo are buried (as it were thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) and our Life is hid with Chriſt in God.</p>
               <p>The ſumme of the practiſe of this Annihilation conſiſts in two things, Light and Remembrance. The uſe of the Light is generall: The uſe of Remembrance is to raiſe us again, when we forget and grow diſtracted.</p>
               <p>For the firſt: This Light is no other but a pure, ſimple, naked,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:135667:67"/> and habituall Faith, which Reaſon helps, Experience ratifies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes. Nor falls it under ſenſe, nor hath any acquaintance therewith; yea it reſiſts the ſame: But it reſides in the Crowne of the ſoule, and beholds God without any Meane. I ſay, 'tis pure; excluding all help of the ſenſes, ſo as all in vaine ſhould any prop or aſſurance bee groped for from them which are utterly to bee renounc'd. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the helpe of that Devotion, which is had from the ſenſes, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures not: but this Faith is laſting. Secondly, becauſe when ſenſible Devotion is had, 'tis not certaine, but variable. But this Faith is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ant. Nor is it ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the ſenſes, unleſſe we alſo annihilate them, becauſe they be erroneous and lying, perſwading <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s to believe that things ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ariwiſe, this faith is lightſome,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:135667:68"/> and points us to walk in the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I call it ſimple, to cut of all multiplicity of Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as a thing repugnant to the purity of this Faith. Firſt, becauſe it makes it humane, where it ſhould be Divine. Secondly, becauſe it moves us to produce Acts, and conſequently to be but cauſes, not Annihilations. Thirdly, becauſe it Clouds, and fumes up Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations betweene GOD and the ſoule.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I call it habituall: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which word is much compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and very remarkable; which is, that it ought to bee continuall without ceaſing or interruption, that ſo wee may ever behold this Infinite of Nothing and All: which though it ſeem hard to doe, yet, that it may be done, two Reaſons ſhall confirme. One is, that as an Angel, though hee be upon earth,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:135667:68"/> yet for the home<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ineſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he hath to his place is ſaid to bee in heaven: So this Light and Faith, though ſometimes they doe not actually ſee this Nothing, and this All, yet through the diſpoſedneſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they accuſtome to behold them, they alwayes perſevere in the ſight of them. And as an Angel in the twinkle of an eye, mounts from earth to heaven: So, this Light and Faith in an Atom's time, reach the actuall contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of God, and this nothing. And as an Angel ſo return'd is counted to have been in heaven, as it were from the beginning; and ſo is verified that Say of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Their Angels doe alway be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the face of my heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> So alſo this Light, when it actually ſees that Myſtery, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when they forget and ſeem to be diſtracted.</p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:135667:69"/>
               <p>Fourthly, I add [which Reaſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> helps.] <hi>i.</hi> the firſt point befor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> mentioned, which is Knowledg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> &amp; Examples. All which arguments are drawne to this word Reaſon, whereby this Faith is aſſiſted. And this contradicts not what wee ſaid before, that this Faith excludes all Reaſoning: for I ſpake this concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſecond point touching the practiſe of Annihilation, the which muſt be free from all multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Diſcourſes. But, here I ſpeake of the firſt point Knowledg, which is ſtrengthned by reaſon and diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>I add, which [experience ratifies and confirmes] <hi>i.</hi> when the ſoule div'd and drown'd in this Infinite, ſees her ſelfe brought to nothing. For, thus her Light and Faith are much encreaſed; ſo that it ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:135667:69"/> bee very eaſie for her to believe this Annihilation, and by this light to dive her ſelfe deeper and deeper therein.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, I ſay, it comes not under ſenſe: The reaſon is; becauſe as the underſtanding is not ſubjacent nor tyed to any Organ, ſo neither is this Light, which pertaines to the underſtanding: whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that it falls not under ſenſe, becauſe no Might of the ſoule can feele without its owne Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, I affirme, that this Faith and Light reſiſt ſenſe; For, they directly fight againſt it. What Senſe affirmes, they deny: Senſe ſaith ſuch or ſuch a thing is; which Faith and Light (in reſpect of Gods preſence) ſay, is not.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, I place this Faith in the Crowne of the Soule, becauſe that place is furtheſt from the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:135667:70"/> and neareſt to God: and it is the very top of the Soule.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, I ſay: It beholds God without Meane: becauſe 'tis not hindered by ſenſe or Senſible things, but ſtands free and cleere from them all.</p>
               <p>Touching the ſecond point: this Remembrance is a certaine Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Illumination, Touching, or Out-breake of Divine Light, which ſtrikes the Soule, and quicker then Lightning ſmites, rowſes, &amp; ſhews her where ſhee is, even loſt in this All, and in the Armes of her Dear. And thus by the furtherance of this Remembrance the ſoule mounts her ſelfe when ſhe ſeemes diſtracted from the Actual ſight and Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of God.</p>
               <p>But note well that I call it a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and not Inturning for two Reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe turning in, ſtirres
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:135667:70"/> Action, ſuch as this Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance hath ſcarce any, by reaſon of the exceeding purity, nakednes, and ſimplicity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe ſuch In-tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning preſuppoſes Out-turning and Diſtraction, which befalls not in this Remembrance, becauſe it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things all Diſtraction whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Againe, I call it Remembrance, becauſe it conſiſts in an act of the ſoule ſo much as in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine working upon her, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from her, but from God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe it changes not the ſtate of the ſoule, making her nearer to the Divine Being, nor the Divine Being nearer to her; but onely lets her ſee where, in what degree, and ſtate ſhe is, even in this All: Alway preſuppoſed that ſhee neglect not her duty in this practice.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, becauſe 'tis ſwift,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:135667:71"/> and paſſes quicker then Act.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, becauſe the ſoule hath it before ſhe can think: Nor can ſhe looke ſo ſuddenly as ſhe hath it againe; And that becauſe of the habit of Light, and Faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe is endowed.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. Of the Imperfections or Impediments of Active Annihilation.</head>
               <p>THE practiſe of this Annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will appeare more cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by oppoſing thereto the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and impediments thereof. And therefore we will here diſcuſſe the ſame.</p>
               <p>And firſt, 'tis an imperfection to doubt of the Reall preſence of God, or to believe the ſame doubtingly, or with a languiſhing and ſleepy faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, not to live by this faith,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:135667:71"/> 
                  <hi>i.</hi> to ſticke at things as if they were ſomething, not waking to behold this luſtre and glory of the Bridegroom, and everlaſtingly to embrace him, who is not onely knowne to be preſent, but of all things only preſent; before whom they all vaniſh and ceaſe to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for any thing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to believe the Senſes, and let them rule over the Light, Reaſon and Faith. To liſten to them, ſince they be lying, and bring in death, whoſe windowes they be. Nor, by them can there be any way to Life, inaſmuch as this Life far tranſcends them. Laſtly, ſince 'tis they wee here fight with to bring them to nothing, therefore in their owne cauſe they can be no Judges, but muſt dye and be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing'd.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to ſhun any neceſſary Worke, outward or inward, for
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:135667:72"/> feare of Diſtraction. For therein appeares the error, Darkneſſe and failing of ſuch Annihilation in accounting that worke to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, where indeed 'tis nothing. And ſurely to him that takes it for ſomewhat, 'tis ſomewhat indeed, and therefore not a little to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But, if his Anihilation were perfect, the worke were nothing, nor worth his feare. Yea, he that ſo abandons a neceſſary worke, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaines double diſadvantage, and incurres a double blindneſſe. Firſt, on the things, which to him is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Darkneſſe: And ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, on the Feares part, which with the ſtroke raiſes obſcurity. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they faile exceedingly, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to doe any thing, repine and excuſe themſelves, deluded under a painted cloak of giving themſelve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to the Spirit. And ſo they run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from that which they ſay
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:135667:72"/> they ſeeke, <hi>i.</hi> from God, who is in that worke, and draw on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a triple darkneſſe and ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocke. 1. Worke. 2. Act. 3. Their owne will and Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, to adjourne a ſimple Converſion to God; which often befalls thoſe who having any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worke, or any Meditation in hand, thinke they cannot come to God till the worke be done, which manner of doing contains two fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: One, that in this work they were not firſt united and annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: the other, that they thought it impoſſible while the work laſted. In both they faile, and flye backe from this Annihilation, wherein if they perſiſted conſtantly, it would diſſolve al things alike, and eternally hold a moſt happy union.</p>
               <p>Herein alſo appeares Senſuality, cloſely hunting for comfort by a
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:135667:73"/> ſenſible Union, which it ſeemes it cannot reach till the worke bee done.</p>
               <p>A 6th. Imperfect. and that a cloſe one, is to turn our ſelves in, as it were, from a place without to a place within; as if God were preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or more in one place then in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which directly oppoſes this Annihilation. For, Annihilation holds us within by the preſentnes of God in al ſteads, and by an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of all thoſe things which might never ſo little turne out or diſtract us. Alſo this turning in, workes againſt kindly Courſe, flying from thoſe things which ſhould fly from us and vaniſh, even All things. For, whilſt the ſoule turnes her ſelfe in, ſhee flyes from things without growing ſomwhat afraid of them: And the more ſhee feares, the thicker they runne in her mind; Beſides, ſhe entertaines
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:135667:73"/> them into Gods place, whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative reaching to be everywher, ſo that at his preſence all things ſhould melt, ſhe contrariwiſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows them ſo much place, that they rather exclude God. Beſides, this Turning in is not free from ſenſe; Nor can it reſt or beleeve it ſelfe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough turn'd in, till firſt it taſte ſome certainty thereof.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, this Inturning is ſuch an Imperfection, that he that uſeth it is ever anew to begin. For, he that withdraws himſelfe from things as oft as any work is to be done, he ſinks again into them; then grows diſtracted, and ſo is to beginne again.</p>
               <p>Inturning therefore I ſay is to be rejected, becauſe Out-turning is never to be admitted, but to live conſtantly in the Infinite of this Divine Being, &amp; the Nothingneſſe of all things. And if a man finde
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:135667:74"/> himſelfe fallen without, let him recover himſelfe by Annihilation, not by Inturning.</p>
               <p>A ſeventh Imperfection is to put a Difference betweene perceiving &amp; not perceiving, <hi>i.</hi> when by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of ſome particular Light, one proves this All and this Nothing: Yet, being thus enlightned, he is not to aſſent more or leſſe to this Truth, then when hee ſeemes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of the ſame Light. Where it happs that divers Men led by ſome eſpeciall pull profoundly into God, doe beleeve with a ſtrong Faith that God is All, and the Creature Nothing: becauſe they ſee it ſo: But, being a little forſaken, and left without taſte, they glide away into another Conceite, and at length to groſſe errour, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king God ſometimes greater, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more preſent then at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times. Yea, they value the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:135667:74"/> Creature ſometimes more, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leſſe; only becauſe they judg not by light of Faith, but by opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their ſenſes.</p>
               <p>An 8th. Imperfection is, to take this Remembrance only as our own Act or proper Motion. For thus in ſome meaſure it ſhould be a Let to true Contemplation. But it is even to be entred primely as the worke and Motion of God, that though ſome little thereof ſeem to be on our part, yet that little may be nothing'd by Active Annihilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that nothing may riſe betwixt God and the ſoule at all.</p>
               <p>A ninth Imperfection is, not to be contented with this Simple Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. The reaſon is, becauſe whatſoever is done either by ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, deſiring, or ſelf-turning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, doth all tend to Being and Multiplication, not to not being and ſimplification. Where many
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:135667:75"/> faile, alwaies almoſt purſuing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whilſt they labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell thoſe things which before they ſhould have knowne to be nothing. Sometimes alſo in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king God, whom alſo wee ſhould beleeve to be neerer us, and more we then our ſelves. And the more they work &amp; ſearch thus, the leſſe they finde becauſe of the great Multiplicity and commotion of the Soule. And contrariwiſe the leſſe they worke and ſearch in this manner, biding content with this ſimple and naked Remembrance, the more they ſhall ſee God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the great ſimplicity and calmneſſe of the Soule.</p>
               <p>To conclude: The laſt Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is, not to perſevere everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly and without ſtop in the practiſe of this Exerciſe of All and Nothing. Yet this failing is ordinary with many, who at
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:135667:75"/> every encountring Act, work, and motion doe cut and knap off the threed of this habituall Annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And ſo following ſenſe, and not naked Faith, they cannot ſee this All in the Creator, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Creatures. The cure of all theſe Imperfections is plain: which is to walke perpetually in this Annihilation, Light, and Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance: as we ſhewed before.</p>
               <p>Now, the cloze and concluſion of theſe 2 Annihilations is, that by the paſſive, the ſoule mounted and taken up to God with all her Mights, abides in high abſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on uncloathed of all Images, in reſt of ſpirit, and ceaſing from acts: In the Active ſhe ſtands alſo fixt, (though not after Senſe) in the very face of all thoſe Acts and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages remayning. Both theſe Annihilations are to bee practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſimple Remembrance.</p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:135667:76"/>
               <p>And that ſoule which duly fans a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all theſe imperfections, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the two Annihilations, ſhall never be denyed a bleſſed arrival in God (preſuppoſing the Common goodneſſe ever at hand.) As on the other ſide, with theſe Imperfections ſhe can never come there.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſſe there be many, who for want of diſcovering and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting them, ſticke many yeares at the threſhold without entrance. Therefore let not him that deſires the true way to Contemplation, grow light-minded, or count them for ſmall matters; for they cannot be ſmall, that hinder ſo great a good.</p>
               <p>'Tis true I confeſſe, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the pull of the holy Ghoſt may be ſo raviſhing, that it may mount the ſoule to God, without punctuall avoydance of all theſe Imperfections. But that grace is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:135667:76"/> and not to be lingred upon, that wee ſhould neglect to gird up our ſelves with all our mights thereto.</p>
               <p>Here note alſo, that as in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour Wil we are not to flye back to the Exteriour, but to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh all our workes according to the Nature of the Interiour Will: So, neither ſhould hee that hath wonne the Tower of this Supere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Will, goe forth any more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>his Annihilation, as wee have ſhewed in this part. But in ſaying that hee ſhould not returne to the exteriour Will, I give no counſell to deſpiſe outward works: for of this errour have I warned the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der elſe-where. But I will that in doing them, they be ſpiritualiz'd and annihiled.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THeſe two Annihilations have each of them his proper Time and Place, which are not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded together. Now that wee may ſee what place is meete for the one, and what for the other; theſe 2 Annihilations make to a two-fold Love. The Paſſive to an enjoying Love, <hi>i.</hi> to a naked beholding Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and enjoyance of God. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to a practicke Love, <hi>i.</hi> to our Outgoing, Lively and faithful working, whether bodily or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:135667:77"/>
               <p>So, then the proper place of the Paſſive Annihilation is when wee lye proſtrate to the Fruitive Love. Becauſe the Paſſive reduces all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and workings to nothing, avants all forms and Images, and ſo leads us to the fruition of God.</p>
               <p>The Place for the active Annihil. is when we are to follow the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick Love: For, by this Annihil. as by a certain tranſcendence of the Mind, all our works, acts, &amp; ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations as wel of the body as ſoul, are nothing'd: ſo going out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going out, working without working, Being without Being, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and yet dead, we transforme the practick Love into the fruitive, &amp; change the Active Life into the Contemplative; Enjoy God by Faith in working and Action, as fully as in reſt and eaſe; which is the Top and ſpire of Perfection.</p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:135667:78"/>
               <p>And theſe are the proper places of the two Annihilations. They erre therefore that diſorder them, and alter their right courſes; uſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Paſſive Annihilatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ſavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Acts and Operations, (as ſome doe) when they ſhould faithfully worke in the Practicke Love. And practiſing the Paſſive Annihilation, producing Acts (as many do) when they ſhould ſuppreſſe them, and enjoy God by Fruitive Love. The firſt run upon a falſe reſt: the other, a hurtfull Activeneſſe. Some tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a too much Retiredneſſe hide their Talent: Others through ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluouſneſſe of working fall ſhort of God. But, that theſe two extreames may be combin'd, and both the Miſtakes amended, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines that we now ſhew the times agreeing to theſe two Annihilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the not knowing whereof, brings the two foreſaid Errours.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:135667:78"/>
               <p>There be three ſorts of Active love, or working: Exteriour, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour, and Intimate; Exteriour, imployed in bodily labours; Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour in diſcourſes and ſtudies; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, in renewing of workings and prayer.</p>
               <p>For the firſt. Though bodily works they be only, yet are they not to be neglected, when obedience, engagement, love, or diſcretion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But if on the other ſide hee refuſe to doe ſuch workes after the ſame Rule, he incurres a dull reſt, the more to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red becauſe vailed with a falſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of Contemplation concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Interiour working, as Studies, diſcourſe, or giving ones ſelfe to the Spirit. The limits of neceſſity are not to be tranſgreſt, &amp; ſuperfluities warily to be avoyded; the which are never free from Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Affections and Negligence, wherein if we be not watchful, no ſmall Immortification &amp; vexation ariſes in the ſoul, which encreaſe &amp; ſwel there the more, the leſſe we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them ſuch; being dawb'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with a vain Tincture of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: Whereout of neceſſity ariſes an inordinate &amp; dangerous liberty of Mind, pouring it ſelf forth into
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:135667:79"/> all kind of phantaſticke thoughts, and loſing the bridle to fleſhly Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations and ridiculous diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, whereout of neceſſity ariſes an inordinate and dangerous liberty of Mind pouring it ſelfe forth into all kind of phantaſticke thoughts, whereby all Paſſions have their free entry. Pride, Selfe-conceit, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, Suſpition, Raſh Judgment, Contempt of our Neighbours, the falſe Joy, Sadneſſe, Feare, Anger, Envy, and of Miſeries what not? which natheleſſe a Dulneſſe &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibleneſſe of the evill makes to be little troubled at; all prick of Conſcience being blunted; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great heede is to bee taken. But if it appeare by this Rule that the Wil of God requires his Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry in Studies, Diſcourſe, &amp;c. and yet hee hangs backe therefrom; 'tis a ſluggiſh faint-heartedneſſe, though vail'd under pretext of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:135667:80"/> of piety, or addicting himſelfe to the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Touching the Intimate working as renewing of our practiſe in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, &amp;c. 'Tis only then to bee produc't when by reaſon of Gods working withdrawn, and our owne waxing faint, or becauſe of feeble and ſluggiſh Nature the Minde is ſunke as it were yawning, and grows heavy, and lets fal from her memory this Bleſſed-making object. Yet, ſo long as by the Pul and Inworking of the Bridegroom, or by ſtrength or rowſing of the Minde, or even by patient cleaving to God, or by ſimple Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, ſhe can perſevere in Union with God in the Fruitive Love; 'Tis not beſt to forſake the Paſſive Annihilation, and the Fruitive Love that depends thereon, to take in hand by acts to practiſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Annihilation: provided that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:135667:80"/> by ſimple Remembrance ſhe ſtand to her part. For there it is that the ſoule is ſo tranſported, inlarg'd, inlightned, and united to God: there ſhe taſts the chaſte embraces, ſweet entercourſes, and divine kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; there ſhe ſees her ſelfe ſublim'd, ennobled, and glorified with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels at the coeleſtiall Table. There ſhe reliſhes the fruits of her Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, the treaſures of her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and the Comforts of all her Selfe-denyalls, and of thoſe weapons ſhee found out to make war upon her ſelfe, for attaining the Kingdome of Heaven, which is to be got by violence. Let her not therefore (I ſay) forſake this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive AnnihilatIon, and the Fruitive Love deſcending therefrom; No, though ſhe feel not thoſe comforts but find this Fruitive Love ſo bare to her feeling, that ſhee loſe all her owne feeling and aſſurance of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:135667:81"/> which is the ſatisfaction of Nature. And this is the true Reſt, wherein both her faithfulneſſe is tryed, and the ſoule is ſeated in a true poverty of Spirit, patience, and eſſentiall Reſignation of her ſelfe. There whatſoever of Man remaines in the ſoule is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. There the Death ended, and the conqueſt atchieved. There is the ghoſt given up betweene the hands of God, and laſtly there is the Man transformed whole into God: For, by this conſtancy and Death, God lives and reignes in him, and in him accompliſhes all his workes. By this Reſt and ceaſing from Acts, is pure abſtraction and Uncloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Spirit attained too, wherein the Soule is ſpung'd of all errours and impurities, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes all vertues and perfections, (though eſſentially and without

For, here is uſed a marvailous defence &amp; watchfulnes of heart, which not only can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure no conſent or delight, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven not the leaſt feeling or thought of Sinne, they being open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to this Reſt and Annihilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo that here all Paſſions are appeaſed, Affections mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Motions reſtrained.

               <p>Wherefore in the practick Love and outward workings, as in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Workes, as alſo in the inward Love or Working, as to labour for vertues, to meditate, to repell vices and temptations, to quench paſſions and affections; none of theſe are to be done as in the Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Will, by ſetting before our ſelves this Eſſentiall Will and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Being, or becauſe God is, or that God may be.

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:135667:87"/> in the ſoule: where contrariwiſe, by our Selfe-will and Darkneſſe we ſhould neither enjoy God, nor behold this Being.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:135667:88"/> and ſince conſequently the practiſe of them conſiſts in theſe two points; wee are here no leſſe to take heart never to ſlide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from this All and this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, then wee were in the other two lives to perſevere in the Divine Will and Selfe-denyall: Reſting ever aſſured, that as oft as we loſe the Divine Being, and finde our ſelves as ſome-what; ſo often we ſtray from the Divine Will &amp; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and follow our owne will and evill.

               <p>Now, having ſeen the way of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick Love, or working outward and inward; we come to the Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate working, the uſe whereof u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to befall in Prayer, when the Soule as we have ſaid finds her ſelf foyl'd and forgetfull of God. But now how pure, how ſimple and ſpritely this working ought to be, &amp; how little acquaintance it ſhould have with our Senſes, is manifeſt from the very name and epithite of Intimate. For, ſince hare Intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Purity, and Spirituality are but one and the ſame thing, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that inaſmuch as nothing is more inward then that which is intimate, that nothing is more pure or ſpirituall. And therefore there is ſuch exceeding purity and ſpritelineſſe required in this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, leſt it ſhould diſturb the ſoul from the Union and Fruitive Love ſinke her too neer to Nature, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:135667:90"/> writhe her too much into her ſelf, but contrariwiſe, rather immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately fix her in Union, and ſeat her in the Divine Being far diſtanc'd from her ſelfe, and tranſcending Nature: Many faile in this Rule of Intimate Acts; ſome more, ſome leſſe.</p>

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:135667:92"/> are declared <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. which may be all drawn to theſe 2. heads, to Adde and to Diminiſh. For, to diminiſh, <hi>i.</hi> to be leſſe employed then in a ſole, pure and ſimple Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, is to ſlide into one of the Extreams, the Falſe Reſt. For, no Man can doe leſſe but hee that's layd dull and halfe aſleepe.</p>
               <p>To adde alſo, <hi>i.</hi> to joyne other Selfe-Acts whereby to come nigher to God then we thinke we can do by this Naked Faith and Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, is to fall into the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame of Hurtfull working.</p>
               <p>For, he that thus betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againe to his own Acts, goes as far backe as he that being unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to work nakedly and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturally by true &amp; pure faith, and not finding there his old ſtaffe of feeling, grows male-contented with this pure and naked Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and falls to redouble hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:135667:92"/> owne manifold Acts, and ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws this Being the further from him, by ſeeking it after ſo uncouth a manner.</p>
               <p>Yet, if at firſt, for the little pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe a Man hath had in the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſuch pure working, any act hap to breake out more then a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Remembrance, the ſame may be nothing'd by Active Annihilation. And the ſame directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> belongs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to them in whom this Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance ſeems to imitate Acts. And contrariwiſe, hee that findes his pulſe too ſlow, let him recover by this ſimple Remembrance, when his Soule is ſo falling and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. Which Remembrance though I may ſay, tis rather to be received as the worke of God then as ours; yet that hinders not but we may have it for ſeeking, ſince this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Being and Light is ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and ſtands at the Doore and

               <p>And thus, the Intimate wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king is plaine. For as in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going chapter, the due time and place are ſhewed where and when the three kinds of working in the practick Love are to be exerciſed; So, here is declared the manner they are to be done in. And thus tis cleer how the two former Lives are drawne to and practiſed in this third without ſhrinking a Jot from the practiſe thereof down to the other. For, as the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher is not to begin again, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the Schooles and rules of Grammar: So he that hath wonne the Tower of this Supereminent Will is not to ſinke or ſlide to the two fore-paſt Lives.

                  <hi>Jacob</hi> ſtucke twi-ſtraked roddes before the eyes of his ſheepe, and ſo made them bring forth Lambes like variouſly ſpeckled. And our

               <p>Againe, this Patterne was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Mount: whence you may gather the wondrous height of this Myſterie, as alſo how much their Judgement is beſotted, who ſuggeſt they have wonne the top thereof in the Active and Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Life: as if either the toppe of this Mount were not paſſing high, or as if in this Myſterie conſiſted not the moſt ſublime Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Our Lord commanded that both the poſts of the Children of Iſraels houſes ſhould be ſprinkled with the blood of the Lambe; ſhewing that hee would have us ſo ever mindfull of the blood and Paſſion of that Lamb which taketh away
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:135667:97"/> the Sinnes of the World, that we could neither enter our Inner houſe by Contemplation, nor goe out by Action, but we ſhould have this blood and Paſſion before our eyes. Which command is alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in that which he gave to the children of Iſrael, whom he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to write his Laws upon the gates of their houſes that they might alway remember them.</p>
               <p>The letter <hi>T.</hi> repreſenting the Croſſe, imprinted on the foreheads of mourners in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſignifies alſo the ſame Remembrance which God would have us beare of his Paſſion: as when he commanded the Children of Iſrael to carry his Law before their eyes, hee would that they ſhould never forget the ſame.</p>
               <p>The Scarlet thread hung up in <hi>Rahabs</hi> window, teacheth us that tis Gods <hi>will</hi> we ſhould hang up his
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:135667:97"/> Croſſe and bloody Paſſion in the Window of our Inner houſe (our underſtanding) that ſo we may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way muſe on, and behold the ſame.</p>
               <p>And ſurely, he that well weighs with himſelfe the Magnificence of that ſupreame Majeſty, and how unſearchable a ſecret it is that ſuch royalty and omnipotency ſhould ſuffer ſo bitter ſorrows, and that to no other end but to be an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to us; he ſhall eaſily grant that the whole ſpace of our Life is moſt excellently ſpent in beholding this Myſterie.</p>
               <p>When God ſpake to <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> he gave him this charge: <hi>Goe down into the Potters houſe, and there thou ſhalt heare my words;</hi> Now, who ſhall wee ſay this Potter is, but the Son of God that frames thoſe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then veſſells, Men? And which ſhould be his Manſion-houſe or
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:135667:98"/> Worke-houſe but his Man-hood; where, by the power of his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he repaires and renews the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments marr'd and broken? If therefore we wait that God ſhould ſpeake to, and direct us in the wayes of the higheſt Perfection and Contemplation, then are we not to prye up to his Deity alone, but to meek our ſelves to his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Paſſion: For there hee hath promiſed to ſpeake to us. There, (ſaith he) thou ſhalt heare my words.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Naomi</hi> counſelled <hi>Ruth</hi> what ſhe had to doe to compaſſe the Marriage of her rich Couſin <hi>Booz,</hi> ſhe willed her to marke the place where he uſed to ſleepe, and having uncovered his feete by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving up the utmoſt rindge of the Coverlet whereunder he repoſed himſelf, there to lay her ſelf down, and ſo ſhe ſhould come to know of

Rich <hi>Booz</hi> perſonates Jeſus Chriſt, who is rich in all, and who is next of kin to the ſoule as to her whoſe Nature he hath aſſumed. The place where he ſleeps is the Croſſe. The Covering, his Man-hood. The ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt and loweſt rindge of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering towards the feet, is his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, full of Ignominies which he ſuffered towards the end and laſt of his Life. And this is that utmoſt border which we are to detect and turn up by Contemplation, where the Royall Kinglineſſe of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſtie will be found. And there is the Soule to caſt her ſelfe downe as another <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> at the feete of Jeſus, where he will ſhew her what's to be done, that ſhe may preſent her ſelf worthy to be his Spouſe.</p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:135667:99"/>
               <p>Our Lord wills us being called to the Wedding, to chuſe to our ſelves the loweſt roome: Sit down (ſaith he) <hi>in the loweſt ſeate.</hi> And after, he that invited thee will ſay, <hi>Come up higher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Marriage is that of the Lambe, whereof tis ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are they that are called to the Supper of the Lamb.</hi> When therefore we are invited thither by Contemplation, we are to take the loweſt place of leaſt reſpect, which is that of his Paſſion, ſo ſhall we appear worthy to heare that word <hi>Come up higher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But too too little humility re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides in that ſoul, which ſlighting our Lords Paſſion, will preſſe up to his Godhead alone. And ſurely ſhe does her ſelf no little diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage thereby: For, in time of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, adverſity, and affliction, ſhe is found ſupportleſſe, and ſo fluttering in the aire, is toſt to

               <head>CHAP. XVII. That God and Man is to be beheld in the Paſſion (the God-head &amp; Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood ſeen together with a ſingle eye) as one, not as two.</head>
               <p>ANd here the Manhood is not to be beheld alone, but alſo the Godhead therewith, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many faile, looking either on the Manhood alone, or ſometimes on it, and ſometimes on the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:135667:100"/> as on two divers objects. And ſo it comes that ſome begin to fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thinking it to be in manner no other Myſterie, but only in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Manhood to phanſie a Man tortured with cruel torments upon a Croſſe; and after, to finde the Godhead, forſaking the ſame object, they preſſe up to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereby to behold the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; not beleeving they can bee rais'd to both at once, the which indeed pertaines to the higheſt pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. For, to ſee God and Man in one ſimple ſight, is not unlike to that knowledge whereby God and Man is ſeene to make one, and the ſame perſon.</p>
               <p>This Contemplation of God &amp; Man ſeemes prefigured in that bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Serpent, whoſe alone ſight cur'd the beholders of their bitings by other ſerpents. A miracle indeed that God ſhould give ſuch power
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:135667:100"/> of healing to the looke of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: Nor doubt I but he would inſinuate to us thereby the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable vertue incloſed in that coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall Serpent which is Jeſus Chriſt crucified, as he cals himſelfe, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as when wee rightly behold the Manhood crucified, we inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behold his Godhead which is God himſelfe, the ſmall cure of all evill.</p>
               <p>For, how can we continue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of ſorrow or croſſe, when we ſee God himſelfe bearing the ſame Croſſe? <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart</hi> ſaith our Lord, <hi>becauſe they ſhall ſee God:</hi> The which divers holy men affirm to be wholly in the next life, and partly in this. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſee God on the Croſſe, we are entred on part of our Bliſſe in this Life, and conſequently cannot feel the pangs of the Croſſe.</p>
               <p>'Twas a thing unheard of, and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:135667:101"/> which with many tranſcended all beliefe, that out of a hard rocke at the ſecond ſmite of the Rod, ſuch plenty of water ſtreamed out. This Rocke is Chriſt Jeſus, (But the Rocke was Chriſt) whoſe Paſſion, though it appeare ſo ſtonie, that at the firſt ſight it yeelds no more but all harſh, hard, and full of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yet if you ſmite the ſame twice by Contemplation of the Godhead and Manhood, you ſhall finde an overflowing Inundation of waters of Comfort, a torrent of Joy, &amp; a ſwift guſhing river flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the face of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaw a Booke written without and within, intimating to us thereby, that Jeſus Chriſt the Booke of Life is written within and without, both ſides contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame perfections: O ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing Booke! O Miracle! O pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy! O new and unuſuall thing,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:135667:101"/> tranſcending and paſſing all Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and far ſurmounting the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of Mans capacity, that all the Attributes of God proper to his Divine Majeſty, ſhould bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in our mortall fleſh: That all the internall perfections of God ſhould be depainted in Man, and to know that perſon as perfect as God, yea to be God himſelfe! O booke (I ſay) beyond admiration even to aſtoniſhment, wherein the eternall omnipotency is deſcribed in externall impotency; Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality in Mortality; Spirit in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; Glory in Ignominy; Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in Bondage, and God in Man. A booke where without is written and diſplayed to the eyes of all men whatſoever the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Father from everlaſting either ſaid or thought. A booke ſhewing us the Croſſe a Tribunall, the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a Throne, and Death the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:135667:102"/> of Je: Chriſt. A book-wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one ſaith, O wondrous power of the Croſſe! O unſpeakable glory of the Paſſion, wherein is both the Throne of our Lord, the judgment of the World, and conqueſt of Chriſt crucified. This is the booke wherein all contrary propoſitions are reconciled, &amp; without diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made all one; where the outer thing is truly knowne the inner; bodily, ſpiritual; weaknes ſtrength, Sorrow, Joy; Contempt, Majeſty; Shame, Glory; Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Greatneſſe; Poverty, Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; Bondage, Freedome; and Torments, Delights.

                  <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw God in the middeſt of the thorny buſh, ſignifying to us that God himſelfe is found in his painefull and thorn-crowned Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and not to be ſought without the ſame.</p>
               <p>No marvell then if Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> the Doctor of the Gentiles and trumpet of truth al over the world exhauſted all his wiſedome from no other fount but out of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſſe of this wiſedome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as himſelfe acknowledgeth, ſaying; <hi>I deſire to know nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you but Ieſus Chriſt crucified.</hi> Which yet, was ſo farre from vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him from high Revelations, that as himſelfe witneſſeth, he was rapt to the third Heaven. Whence it is cleerer then the Noone-day Light, that in the crucified Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, he alſo ſaw the boundleſſe depth of the Godhead.</p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:135667:103"/>
               <p>But the Centre of all this Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty conſiſts in the right ſending forth of this Simple ſight, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God and Man is ſeene (neither omitted.) For, in failing of either, we incurre a like loſſe: The depth of the Myſterie being founded in both one, and not in each apart. For, firſt, to behold God Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and then a miſerable and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn Man, which he became by his Incarnation; This worketh ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in the ſoule by way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration: But to ſee both one (as wee have ſaid) and to behold it with a ſingle eye, and naked aſpect, that ſtrikes the ſoule with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and bereaves her of all her forces. And this is that ſimple and perfect Contemplation which our Lord extolls with ſo many prayſes in his Spouſe in the <hi>Cantic. Thy eyes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And all the Impediment of this Contemplation ariſes from no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but a Contradiction ſeeming to darken the reaſon of Man, that ſo it is diſabled to behold in one ſimple ſight, God and Man; Body and Spirit. For, to behold the Manhood which is corporeall, an Image muſt bee let in. To behold the Godhead, no Forme, but pure Denudation. So then, to ſee both one, ſeemes as if you would ſay, Receive a forme and no forme. And this to many is a ſtumbling ſtone.</p>
               <p>But, now to unty this Knot: we are to tranſcend all Reaſon, &amp; flye to Faith, which ſeeing him Man, ſtands invincible, that hee is God without all forme and Image whatſoever. And though Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation inject the forme Man, yet Faith (diſdaining all ſenſe) conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:135667:104" rendition="simple:additions"/> no forme, faſtning her eye on God. So that, though an Idea of Jeſus Chriſt crucified preſent it ſelf to us, yet the Ocean of Faith drownes and annihilates the ſame.</p>

This <hi>Paul</hi> deſires we ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and is fervently zealous to confirme the ſame Trueth, ſaying, <hi>I live; yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me. Seeke yee a proofe of Chriſt ſpeaking in mee? Bearing about in our body the Dying of the Lord Jeſus. Till Chriſt hee formed in you Let this mind be in you which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus. I am crucified with</hi> Chriſt. <hi>Becauſe wee are his members of his Fleſh and of his Bones. Yee are the body of Chriſt, and members in particular. Know ye not that your Members are the Temple of the holy Ghoſt which is in you? So many of you as are baptized have put on Chriſt. Chriſt Jeſus is in you unleſſe ye bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates.</hi>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:135667:109"/> And many other places, whereby he ſhews his earneſt Deſire to teach Chriſtians this Wiſdome, and particularly in this laſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, where he ſeemes to inforce that he will have us beleeve it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing this neceſſity of having Chriſt in us, or elſe of being repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated from him.</p>
               <p>I could here bring authorities of many Fathers if the Brevity of this Manuall would permit: Since then Chriſt Jeſus is in us, and where he is he is to be adored, it followes that he is to be adored in our ſelvs, and thereupon a holy Father ſaith, 'Tis more excellent to behold him crucified in our ſelves then at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem. And one holy Saint conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Paſſion of Chriſt our Lord in his members, ſo much, that he was no leſſe pained when he ſaw any other afflicted, then if he had ſeene Chriſt himſelfe in the ſame plight.</p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:135667:109"/>
               <p>Yea, our ſufferings not onely may be beheld as the ſorrowes of Jeſus Chriſt, but ſometimes they cannot be beheld otherwiſe. I mean, when through fervour of Love our ſorrowes be ſo commixt and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſorrows of ſweete Jeſus, that we may ſee him alike in both; neither can ours be ſeparated from his, there can be but one onely Chriſt in both made one (ours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring in his.) Nor otherwiſe in the one then in the other can ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour be given to him, ſince where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he is ſeene and diſcerned, all adoration and glory is due to him in the ſorrows themſelves.</p>
               <p>Having concluded then that 'tis true that we may behold Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in our ſelves, it reſts that wee ſhew why the ſame is more worthy then to imagine and behold him ſuffering at Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>That reall ſuffering which wee
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:135667:110"/> taſt in our ſelves, preſents a farre more ſpritely Image of the Paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, then that which hovers in Imagination alone. And that which we feele inwardly, then that which is ſpeculated outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. As our owne headach or paine of any other member, gives us a far more lively feeling of the like affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in any of our friends, then if we fancied the ſame from here-ſay alone. Juſt ſo, my owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the torments of Chriſt in my ſelfe, makes mee abundantly more ſenſible of them, then if I ſaw them onely by apparition in my phantaſie. Whereof one ſaith: By ſuffering, a man learns to co-ſuffer with him that ſuffers.</p>
               <p>If in our ſorrows we behold the Paſſion without, us that ſeemes to beget Multiplicity, the Soule ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from her owne paines to the pains of Chriſt, but beholding the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:135667:110"/> Paſſion of Chriſt in ourſelves, wee ſee but one onely ſimple object of the paines of both.</p>
               <p>And thus this whole practiſe is drawn into our interiour: And we have the work within us, the Wch is an high ſtep. To ſee the Paſſion in our ſorrows, the Conflict is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. But to behold the ſame in ourſelves preſuppoſes abſolute vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. Againe, the end for which we behold the Paſſion is, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed thereto. But thus, by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Paſſion in our ſorrows, we are conformed thereto by a joyfull and free willing acceptation of the ſame in the Union and Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the ſufferings of Chriſt. <hi>Ergo,</hi> by beholding the Paſſion in our ſorrowes wee reach the end of the Contemplation of the Paſſion. Beſides, many cannot, but very hardly and without continuance, behold the Paſſion of Chriſt in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination:
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:135667:111"/> But, none need miſſe the ſame by feeling in his own ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. For, many are deſtitute of apprehenſive Imagining: but none wants the lively ſenſe of his owne afflictions.</p>
               <p>Againe, if being round ſet with ſtraits, wee flye to the Paſſion of Chriſt without us; we ſhal ſeem to turn our back plainly on ſorrows, and to ſhrink from paines ſo far as we can, preſſing to him more to ſeeke our own Comfort then for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny true Love to him. But, when we ſee him in our paines within our ſelves, we eaſily embrace the bitterneſſe as his, and cheerefully purſue the Cuttingneſſe of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as that which nailes us with him on the Croſſe.</p>
               <p>The Union made by thoſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering which are in us, is ſo much the cloſer, the more wee taſte the Gall: And the truer and perfecter,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:135667:111"/> the more truly thoſe paines bee in that Union, and not in memory alone.</p>
               <p>If in our Paines wee conſider the Paſſion, the more we ſuffer, the cloſer wee ſhall be united to God. But if we behold it without us, the Tempeſt of affliction may breake that Union with him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis moſt excellent, ſaith the ſame Saint, to behold him in his Paſſion within our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Confirm'd therefore on holy Scriptures produc't, let us bide ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly fixt in our own paines as in the Torments of Jeſus Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting all looſeneſſe, wavering, &amp; all queſtions ariſing, to inquire whether the Paſſion of Chriſt bee truly in them or no. Such as for the moſt part a Soul ſhallow illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate uſeth to frame. The which practiſe he may eaſily ſtand unſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in, that is truly faithful to the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:135667:112"/> Croſſe; who with all his heart em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces Tribulation, never langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing for comfort. For, in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the preſence of Jeſus Chriſt by grace ſhall never be doubted of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will there nakedly unvail himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Nor ought any man to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to this practiſe till firſt hee be wain'd from the Dug of conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and tempered to endure the edge of bitterneſſe. Nor want there ſome that would wiſh to ſuffer with Chriſt on the Croſſe, but led with Intention that thoſe ſtones ſhould be made bread: and the Gall ſuddenly chang'd into Honey, dreaming all the while that they follow the Croſſe, which with all their might they avoid. Which makes them as far from diſcerning Jeſus Chriſt, as there is difference betwixt to quake at the Croſſe and to honour it: or to loath it as a
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:135667:112"/> Serpent, and to welcome it as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired good. Above all, tis chiefely remarkable that to finde Chriſt in his Paſſion in us, we muſt ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but dolours and afflictions. For, he that ſhould ſeeke, yea or entertain ſenſible Comfort, ſhould open a free paſſage to Illuſions.</p>
               <p>Let therefore all our paines and tribulations be welcommed, not as croſſes, but as Jeſus Chriſt. Let him be conſidered and beheld as crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in us. Let all our ſorrowes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and evills whatſoever of body or of ſoule, bee caſt into the burning fornace and flames of the Torments of Jeſus, where they may be all conſummate and united to his ſorrowes. So may we truly ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt.</hi> And follow his exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>Let this mind be in you which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Nor let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny turn it to preſumption thus to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:135667:113"/> know &amp; behold God in our pains: But rather let him ſee how that the Inventory of al vertues is infolded therein, which Truth it ſelfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies and confirmes.</p>
               <p>And firſt, a perfect Selfe-denyall here ſhowes it ſelf, which not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſtraines a Man ſetting aſide all ſelfe-ſeeking to beare patiently afflictions, reproaches, and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, but alſo to welcome them joyfully, &amp; to accept them as high favours. There appeares alſo in that ſoule an invincible Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe towards her Coeleſtial Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome, inaſmuch as ſhe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges him not only in himſelfe, but alſo in his Creature, embracing him in the thicket of thorny affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, in Littleneſſe looking up to Greatneſſe, and adoring him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and forlornneſſe. And now I ſay, what a wondrous reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is found in this practiſe
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:135667:113"/> where the Cup is thus received? What Unconqueredneſſe, where tis thus ſupt off? What a patience in this Endurance? What undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maidneſſe in thus caſting her ſelfe among the Thorns? What a flame of Love where thus ſhe head-longs her ſelfe into the fornace of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations? What a ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in thus refuſing to goe forth? Yea, annihilating her ſelf that God may be exalted in her heart, as 'tis ſaid, Man ſhall goe to a high mind and God ſhall bee exalted. And laſtly, where, that Chriſt may live, the ſoule chuſes to dye, as they that ſaid, We received the ſentence of Death within our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Nor can Preſumption take any place in us, becauſe there we diſcern the Paſſion of our Lord. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can ſo diſcerne him, wee muſt be as farre eſtranged from our ſelves, as from all other things, by
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:135667:114"/> an abſolute Selfe-denyall, and by hearty embracing of bitterneſſe and affliction. Nor, can we there think our ſelves to be any thing becauſe of the preſence of God, whom we behold within us.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, though I take this practiſe for the more perfect, yet ſince divers men have divers devotions, I would not tye al ſorts of Soules to this way, eſpecially thoſe that ſtand not yet in high favour in the Godhead, though otherwiſe they have growne up in ſpirituall Life. For, ſuch cannot perfectly diſcerne how God is in their Afflictions.</p>
               <p>There be alſo ſome events wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 'tis requiſite to behold the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Lord in himſelf, as when no occaſion preſents it ſelfe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his Paſſion in our ſelves, neither by affliction, bitterneſſe, nor any contradiction. For,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:135667:114"/> though an Illuminate Man can hardly want occaſion to practiſe it in himſelfe, ſometimes by accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of bitterneſſe, ſometimes by refuſing of pleaſure, bodily or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall: yet ſometimes it happens that either no ſuch is preſented, or elſe tis ſo little, and almoſt of no moment, that it beates ſcarce any or no impreſſion in the Soule, ſo that the Paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt cannot be diſcerned in her.</p>
               <p>Alſo in making a long prayer. For, then ſuch flouds of Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences ſtreame into the Soul, that all ſenſe of affliction, contradiction &amp; bitternes is ſpent, &amp; no impreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them left in the Soule: So that ſhe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſee the Paſſion in her ſelf.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Paſſion of Chriſt cannot be ſeene in our ſelves when the ſoule is ſo ſublimely rayſed, and findes the Paſſion ſo perfectly in her ſelfe, that ſhe cannot but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:135667:115"/> that Paſſion which Chriſt ſuffers in her and that which hee ſuffered in himſelfe to be but only one. For then ſhee ſees his paynes ſometimes in himſelfe, ſometimes in her ſelf without difference. Eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoons alſo almoſt al the ſtations of the Paſſion at once without multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, (a matter of high moment) yet nothing letted by variety of the formes; becauſe ſhee ſees God alone in them all.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIX. What this Image ought to be, and how tis to be beheld.</head>
               <p>NOw come wee to ſee what a one this Image ought to bee whereunder we behold the Paſſion. And firſt, I ſay, if it bee the Image of the paines of Chriſt our Lord himſelfe, it need not be univerſall, (I meane of the whole Paſſion) but
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:135667:115"/> of ſome particular part thereof, that ſo it may bide printed in the heart and imagination, without which impreſſion it falls from the memory, and ſo muſt that contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation which depends thereon. But, if that Image be of his paynes in us, then may it well be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall of all the dolours and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, inaſmuch as the impreſſion of our feeling makes us alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them; yet chiefely, wee are to apply ourſelves to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt of them, for there will Jeſus ſhew himſelfe moſt, becauſe wee there finde our ſelves leaſt.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if wee deale with the Paſſion of our Lord in himſelfe, it muſt be imaginary, but if wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it as it is in ourſelves, it is not then to be imagined, but beheld juſt ſuch as wee really feele in our ſelves.</p>
               <p>But whether of the two ſoever
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:135667:116"/> it be, wee muſt neither adde nor detract one jot from the forme thereof; but without the leaſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, to receive the ſame exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it offers it ſelfe. Where many erre, longing to change them both into another more exquiſite, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and godlike, deſpiſing as it were that ſimple and naked forme of Chriſt crucified that firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it ſelfe to the eye, as too baſe, earthly, corporeall, and having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt nothing divine or excellent therein: where, flat contrary, the more vile and forlorne the image or forme is whereunder we behold the Almighty crucified; the more ſtupendous will the myſtery ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, and the ſoule bee the higher raiſed; which is moſt remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>The ſame I ſay alſo of that forme which is in our ſelves not by ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, but by taſting of ſorrow,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:135667:116"/> heavineſſe and bitterneſſe, bodily or ſpirituall: that it behoves us to reſt therein content, neither alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it by our owne induſtry, nor languiſhing to have it changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another forme by infuſion of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſweetneſſe or conſolation. Where many deceive themſelves, who toſſed with the waves of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſſe &amp; ſenſuality, ſeem to ſay to our Lord; If thou beeſt the Son of God, command that theſe ſtones of hard affliction bee made bread of comfort. In this hunting for comfort appeares ſeanſuality: in ſaying, [If thou be the Sonne of God] unfaithfulneſſe ſhewes her ſelfe; as indeede it befalls too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that the ſoule ſeeing ſuch an image or bitterneſſe, growes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled and doubts whether God be there or no; or whether ſhee ought to honour and behold him under ſuch a forme, and thereupon
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:135667:117"/> to free her ſelfe of all doubting, ſhe ſinkes to take ſome proofe thereof by taſting ſome ſweetneſſe, and by changing thoſe ſtones of Affliction into Bread of Comfort. Or elſe ſeeing him upon the Croſſe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row meane eſteem and debaſement impos'd upon us, hurried with Temptation of Infidelity; we ſay <hi>[If thou beeſt the Sonne of God]</hi> to whom (under what forme ſoever appearing) adoration belongs. <hi>Come downe from the croſſe.</hi> Let mee ſee this Manhood advanc't upon ſo high a Croſſe of Contempt, come down and aſſume ſome other ſhape more lightſome, glorious, Majeſticall, and becomming the Son of God; and then I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve thee. Thus for want of live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith and deſire to ſuffer, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſſe and ſenſuality hang alwayes after the Taſt of ſome ſweetneſſe, requiring a change in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:135667:117"/> ſome more ſpritely and radiant forme wherein to behold Jeſus Chriſt. Which is the very cauſe why they cannot diſcern him, and that they incur extream diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the Practiſe of the Paſſion.</p>
               <p>To prevent which miſchiefe, we muſt behold ſuch contempt or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety abſolutely as we feel it, and juſt in the ſame meaſure; looking therein on Chriſt crucified; or on the other manner juſt as we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine him ſuffering on Mount Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vary, and there confeſſe him with a ſimplified and invincible faith.</p>
               <p>Moreover, ſuch form of Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or Contempt is not onely ſimply and faithfully to bee wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com'd, but the very Cuttingneſſe thereof to be graſped, by him that will tread the ſteps of Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. I call that Cuttingneſſe which paineth and bireth ſoreſt, ariſing from a Triple kind of Afflictions;
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:135667:118"/> Temporall, Bodily, Spirituall. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of which afflicts the Spirit through bitterneſſe and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Nature. And this inward bitterneſſe I call the Cuttingneſſe of affliction, which we are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to hold, embrace, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, as the Key which opens up the Cloſet-doore of the Treaſures of Divine Wiſedome, and diſcloſes the profound Miſteries of this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Which ſharpneſſe, if it bee blunted by Conſolation, is to be edg'd again by recording thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; which if wee neglect by ſinking to Conſolation, the ſoule ſhall never be through lighted by the Divine Wiſedome. And here many ſoules falter, at firſt indeed beholding Chriſt in their or his ſorrowes; but as ſoone as ever hee ſhewes himſelfe to them after their own Deſire and as themſelves wiſh, they let themſelves ſlide into a
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:135667:118"/> Contemplation of Chriſt alone without the Croſſe, leaving his bitter ſufferings behind them, and ſo they never come to dive and ſound the depth of this Myſterie, nor to learn the admirable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Wiſdome hid therein. For, this bitterneſſe of Affliction is that whereof 'tis ſaid, Affliction gives Underſtanding. 'Tis the Gall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Nor let her raiſe her Minde higher then to the height of this Forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, wherein if ſhee valiantly abide confident and ſolid, ſhe ſhall not fail to finde the moſt Higheſt: Nor let her ſeek or deſire God, but ſecurely beleeve ſhe has found him. Nor let her behave her ſelfe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then as ſtanding before his Throne; Nor let her doubtinly waver, but ſticke to Trueth; not truſting Senſe, but Faith: Nor, let her turne her ſelfe inward, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate her ſelfe before God. Nor let her produce any Intellectuall Act, but only reſt ſatisfied with this ſimple ſight &amp; lively Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of this great Al crucified, as we have ſhewed in the 10th. &amp; 13th Chap. And let her yeeld her ſelf a

And chiefly let her beware that ſhee behave not her ſelfe workingly towards him, but above all that ſhe attempt not one jot to alter that ſimple form wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he appeares to her; it being his worke to transforme her through that forme, and to faſhion her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his good pleaſure. And note well that thoſe deſires of ſeeing God in another manner, is the very and only cauſe that the Soule can never ſee him Wonderful as he is, becauſe thoſe deſires interrupt her Conſtancy and ſolid reſt in that form, debarring the profound Adoration &amp; Honour due to him; yea, making void that Faith wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God is beleeved to be there.

               <p>ANd now the ſoule having won thus high, and eſtabliſht
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:135667:120"/> in the practiſe of the Paſſion: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother doubt ariſes within her touching the Contemplation of the ſame, <hi>i.</hi> whether ſhe is to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it to riſe to the Godhead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
               <p>And indeed, many there be who caſting one glance at the Paſſion, long ſtrait to mount to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; Others diſreſpecting the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion are, as they thinke, directly tranſported to the Deity by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Tranſcendence of the Minde, which for the moſt part I ſuſpect rather Naturall then Supernatural; and Imaginary then reall. I take it (under correction of better judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) that that Contemplation is moſt advantagious, high and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which is had in the Paſſion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and moſt acceptable to him, and not to bee forſaken for any other how high ſoever, though ſuch were even of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:135667:121"/> to the ſoule. Which to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, I will bring ſome reaſons &amp; authorities of Fathers to prove the ſame.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we are not to leave the Paſſion to behold the Godhead; but to behold both together.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That we are not to forſake it though a gate ſeemed to be ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and the ſoule to bee lur'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Contemplation of the Paſſion is the moſt perfect and higheſt of all others.</p>
               <p>For the firſt point. We ſay, ſince our Life in this World is alway both Active and Contemplative, it needs a light for both. This Light is Chriſt Jeſus. His Godhead illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates us in Contemplation. It is Manhood ſhewes Action. And even as he grows ſlenderly in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation that ſees not his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head to draw Light therefro; ſo
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:135667:121"/> neither in Action moves he rightly that propoſes not his Manhood for direction. And as in the whole courſe of our Life, there is alway ſomewhat to be done, ſo this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is alway to be borne before our eyes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in Contemplation of the Paſſion, Fervour and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flames ſtirre up to Conformity and operation; but abſtract Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the Godhead alone, produceth no ſuch effect.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in the one God is found in ſtability of ſtrength and practiſe as well outer as inner; In the other he is only found in the Inner; but as for the outer, all growes cold, when need requires we goe forth to operation; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the ſame requires any length of time. In the one the ſoule, when ſhee ſhould act is left naked, by ſinking from her object
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:135667:122"/> whence ſhee borrowed her Light; but in the other, ſhee's not ſo left, becauſe ſhe retaines the ſame object in Contemplation that ſhe does in Action.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The one acquires us an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, but no exteriour habite: The other enriches us with both.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Contemplation of the Paſſion containes thoſe two wayes leading to God; Abnegation and Affection. But the Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Godhead, kindles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Affection, but ſhewes no ſuch practiſe of Abnegation.</p>
               <p>How ſhall any man be thought to love Jeſus Chriſt, that turnes his back upon him hanging on the Croſſe, that ſo loſing fight of him he may give himſelfe to Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the Godhead?</p>
               <p>For the ſecond point, wee are not only to cleave faſt to the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on willingly, and with all our
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:135667:122"/> might, and not to the Godhead alone: But alſo none ought to let himſelfe be drawne from it; No, though he had ſome Inclination, and a doore ſeemed to ſtand open: For, if upon every call which ſeems to lure aloft, the Paſſion ſhould be left, it would never be poſſible to ſearch out &amp; diſcover the depth of this Myſterie: which, as it is grounded not only in the heigth of the Godhead, but alſo in the forſakenneſſe of the Manhood, ſo, that it may be throughly ſounded, both muſt be beheld, and not the Godhead alone. For, as one cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a Tree, cannot conſider the height of it, if he ſtare at the Top only, never looking at the root<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:135667:123"/> overlooking the forſaken and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed Manhood. And as thoſe two be conjoyned in the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſo they are to be beheld with one ſimple ſight, and not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part</p>
               <p>Where, in my judgement, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny erre very much, who finding ſome Light by beholding the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; when by meanes thereof they ſhould dive into the ſame with a ſteadier eye, and ſearch deeper to the Intimateſt ſecrets of this ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous Myſterie, there to finde that ſupreame God cloathed with Mortall Fleſh, beaten with ſtripes, boar'd with nayles, and cruelly faſtned to a Croſſe, till the raviſht Soule roar'd out, and were forc't to goe forth of her ſelfe; they on the contrary ſtraight forſake the Manhood, and imboldned by that ſmall glympſe they have got, preſſe to ariſe to his naked God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:135667:123"/> whither nathleſſe they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine not, but leave it as fluttering in the ayre; Or if they ſeeme to approach it, the ſame is ſo little that the Soule ſoone faints, little bettered thereby, wandring Light-mindedly, untempered to endure the fulgour of Divine Light, but thence held off remains a Vagreſs, growing in no knowledge either of the Godhead alone by abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or of the Godhead &amp; Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood together by the Paſſion.</p>
               <p>In the Paſſion we finde the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Godhead ſuited to our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, which of it ſelfe is a Light inacceſſible. For, as he that would ſee the Sunne, darts not his eyes immediately upon his gliſtering rayes, but taking a baſon or ſome other veſſell of water, fits the ſame to his fight: So may we ſay of the Godhead, which hee that deſires to ſee, muſt hehold it in
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:135667:124"/> the Manhood wherein 'tis adapted to the ſight of the Soule. And as he that will looke full at the Sun, rather dazles the quickneſſe of his ſight (witneſſe they that will look on him in his eclipſe) ſo, thoſe ſouls which overtopping the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thood preſſe to adhere immediately o the Godhead, do no other but blind themſelves. Nor let them thinke that God inviteth them to his Naked Godhead when hee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts that Light; But he gives that Light that they may the better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his Paſſion, and not that they ſhould prye up to his naked God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: For, if the Manhood were ſo ſleightly to be left to proceed to the Godhead alone, then were it granted and concluded that the Paſſion is ſcarce at al to be minded: for, it requires ſome Light: If then having received that Light, wee muſt ſtraight flye to the naked
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:135667:124"/> Godhead, diſmiſſing the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; What then ſhall become of the knowledg of this Myſterie, and the Imitation of the pattern of our Life?</p>
               <p>But, God by imparting ſuch Light to us, is ſo farre from invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us to behold his naked God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head that contrariwiſe, hee gives the Soul endeavouring the ſame, a touch of her miſtake, ſaying: <hi>Turn away thy eyes from me, for they have drove me away.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, So long as thou lookedſt on my Paſſion, thou ſawſt me and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt me after thy hearts deſire; both Manhood and Godhead at once: But ſince thou withdreweſt from thine eyes the glaſſe of my Paſſion which proportioned me to thy ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pableneſſe, and haſt betook thee to behold my God-head alone, the luſtre of whoſe ſight thy weak eves are not able to endure, I have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:135667:125"/> my ſelfe from thy ſight and fled far from thee. Turn then away thine eyes from me and from my ſole Godhead, and faſten them on my Paſſion; there thou ſhalt find me abundantly.</p>
               <p>We are not therefore by help of ſuch Light to ſoare aloft, though God impart that Light unto us, unleſſe the Attraction of the holy Ghoſt be ſo Majeſticall that it ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend all the powers of the Soule, as by repture or extaſie. For, then the ſoule (her weake forces ſpent) muſt let goe her hold, and yeeld to the Rapt.</p>
               <p>The Angel having wreſtled long and ſtrong with <hi>Jacob,</hi> at length ſpying light, ſaid, Let me goe, Tis morning. The Angell repreſents our Lord; <hi>Jacob</hi> the Chriſtian. Their wreſtle, that lowly and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke duel acted betwixt God and his Spouſe, who finding him in
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:135667:125"/> his Paſſion, cryes out; <hi>I found him whom my ſoule loveth;</hi> God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten not made, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiall with the Father, by whom all things were made. And ſeeing that great God thus cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in our fleſh, and therein tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured with Torments, rapt in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, and drunke with his Love, faſtning her eye on him in this Agony, and now enflam'd with Zeale and Love, ſhee vowes never to goe thence, but embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him cloſe, cryes out; <hi>I caught him, nor will I let him goe;</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with <hi>Jacob; I will not let thee goe.</hi> And now his Godhead and Manhood making but one and the ſame perſon, ſhe cannot ſee the one without the other. Now, here begins the wreſtle: The ſight of his Godhead lures her aloft, the ſight of her Manhood holds him
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:135667:126"/> faſt below. Both which ſhe behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with one ſimple ſight, is drawn at once both up and down. If ſhe twine from his Manhood, ſhe is taken up by his Godhead: But, becauſe ſhee had rather ſee both then the Godhead alone, and how he is both mortall and immortall, great and little, alſo cleerly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern his Love, Goodneſſe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perfections and abſtruſe My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries: And laſtly becauſe ſhee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and burnes to ſuffer on the Croſſe with her Bridegroome, ſhe clings perpetually to his Manhood ſaying, <hi>I caught him, nor will I let him goe till, &amp;c.</hi> On the other ſide, God who never withdrawes from her the ſight of his Godhead, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently by the ſame mounts her aloft, and ſweet-ſpeaking her by the Lure, (ſhe faſt to the Cruciſix) he ſaid, Let me goe, 'tis morning: Behold my Godhead, the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:135667:126"/> of eternall Life: But ſhe wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing his delight in her harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Nay-ſay, and how much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaminger 'tis to bind then to looſe him, anſwers; <hi>I will not let thee goe till thou haſt bleſſed mee;</hi> that I may behold thee both raigning in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſuffering upon the Croſſe, and as nakedly and perfectly love and adore thee in the one as in the other. Then her Lord ſeeing her Invincible, and that hee cannot winde from her by the Lure of his Godhead becauſe of her wondrous fidelity &amp; conſtancy to the Croſſe, he overflows her with his Bleſſing, ſubſcribing to all her requeſts in the Paſſion. And there he bleſt her in the ſame place, even of his bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Paſſion. In the ſame place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there ſtrength is hid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:135667:127"/> the powers, the Bow, the ſhield, the ſword and the battle of the World, the Fleſh and the Devill.</p>
               <p>And theſe Hornes of the Altar are they from which <hi>Joab</hi> could not be forc't to depart; no, though King <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf commanded, but chuſed rather to dye there; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that the Paſſion is never to be forſaken, but perſiſted in to death, though ſome thinke that ſince God hath vouchſafed them a glimmer of the Light of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, he therefore calls them up, and to forſake the Paſſion. For, this humility and lowly wreſtling with Chriſt our Lord, joyes him above Meaſure, even when with al our heart we love the Contempt and lowneſſe of the Paſſion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he ſeeme to invite us high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. For, then hee double requites that Humility, in that Lowneſſe revealing the height of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:135667:127"/> And this he meant when he counſelled us being bidden to the Wedding, <hi>to chuſe the loweſt place:</hi> for then hee calls us, and by the Light imparted doubles his Call unceſſantly, <hi>Come up.</hi> Not to draw to his Godhead alone by forſaking his Paſſion, but that he may ſhew us his Godhead there in the ſame place, whoſe ſight rayſes the ſoul to the higheſt without diſtraction from the loweſt.</p>

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:135667:128"/> we ought not ſo much to gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on the ſweet meates of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that wee forget him on the Croſſe, and that divine Arke, both remaining in ſo meane a Manſion, and ſo unworthily entreated; But rather paſſing by the Comfort with him that ſaid, My ſoule refuſed Conſolation, we are to lodg ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, bewailing the Miſeries of our ſweeteſt Redeemer, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in Spirit his paines and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.</p>
               <p>This Practiſe <hi>Paul</hi> extols, who though hee abounded with ſuch plenty of Lights, yet profeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to know nothing elſe but Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt and him crucified.

               <p>For the third point I judge it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to confirme that the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the Paſſion, wherein appeares both the Divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature of our Lord, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecter then that wherein we behold his Godhead alone.</p>

                  </gap>lative and Active in one, is perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter then Contemplation by it ſelf: So the Contemplation of both Godhead &amp; Manhood in one (as is found in the Paſſion,) containes more perfection then that of the Godhead alone, practiſed in Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction.</p>
               <p>God is more wonderfull with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out then within himſelfe: For in himſelfe, hee's only great, immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, &amp; impaſſible. But without him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:135667:129"/> hee's both great and little, immortall and mortall, impaſſible and paſſible. 'Tis a ſtrange thing to ſee a Man through exceſſe of Love or ſome other paſſion carried without himſelfe. But to ſee the ſame in God through his Love to us, is much more to be admired at, without Compariſon. Yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and Man is this Dffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that when Man is without himſelfe, hee is not within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: But God is both at once, Al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>within and All without himſelfe. His univerſall power, wiſdome &amp; goodneſſe being abſolutely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out himſelfe in his Manhood, and within himſelfe in his Godhead. Beſides, as tis a ſtranger thing that God ſhouldbe without then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf: So, 'tis more excellent to behold him without then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelfe.</p>
               <p>But, as in the practiſe of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:135667:129"/> ſuch a ſweetneſſe is hidden, as never any Will naturally taſted; ſo the Contemplation of the ſame diſcovers ſuch a wiſdome, as never any humane underſtanding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. And as we can come no other way to the knowledg of this taſt, but only by experience; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any poſſibility but by the ſame experience to imagine what a Wiſdome it is. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the one hath ſuch ſweetnes in it as the world cannot beleeve; ſo the other inrolls ſuch Myſteries and Divine ſecrets as Man can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver imagine. The one comes by that infinite goodneſſe infuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Will through the practiſe and Union of the Croſſe: The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by that eternall wiſedome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſed to the Underſtanding by Contemplation of this Myſterie. Daily are new Joyes of this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe taſted: and endleſſely new
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:135667:130"/> ſecrets of this Wiſedome diſcloſed: And both exhauſted from this fount of the Paſſion. For, as the world can never conceive how 'tis poſſible that a Man crowned with thornes can expend ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, or how the fellowſhip of his ſufferings can inebriate the minde with ſuch pleaſures: ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it ever imagine how in ſo vile and forlorn a Condition ſuch a height of Myſterie ſhould bee comprized. And as ſuch wondrous Joyes and Myſteries are grounded in a ſolid ſtaidneſſe upon this point, that that Man is God: So on the other ſide our Not-finding of thoſe delights and ſecrets, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from our drowſie wavering in the ſame. And herein ſtands all the Keeping-downe of our Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call buildings, and all the ruine of our ſpirituall growth, becauſe in the Paſſion wee duely conſider not
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:135667:130"/> God and Man in the ſame perſon. For, if there wee as verily found God as Man, and knew both to make but one onely perſon, wee ſhould not aſpire to any higher or loftier Contemplation, becauſe wee ſhould then underſtand that ſame to be highneſſe it ſelfe. And how can any deny the Manhood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be the lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt Contemplation of all others, when in the ſame hee can ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is not God? It being a Sea vaſt and ſpacious, wherein e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one may ſet ſaile more or leſſe according to his Veſſells burthen. So that all they that fall ſhort of the depths of the Godhead may juſtly blame themſelves for want of capacity &amp; Light, but never im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Ieaſt defect to this ſea of the Paſſion boundleſſe and infinite. And therefore wee are to ſticke to the ſame as to the ultimate end, not
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:135667:131"/> as to a thing low and vile, but as to God himſelf high and glorious; For, as he that cleaves to this man, cleaves to God, ſo he that embraces his Paſſion, enjoyes the higheſt good.</p>
               <p>And ſurely, if in the Paſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted not the moſt perfect and high Contemplation, then would not that great S<hi rend="sup">t.</hi> 
                  <hi>Bon.</hi> have placed it in the latter, as being higher then that of the Being of God and his Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Attributes, Trinity and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Myſteries of his Godhead, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Chriſt is the perfect Image of God naturally inviſible, and that in this Contemplation we ſee the Manhood ſo miraculouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, ſo uneffably united by ſeeing both in one, the firſt and the laſt, the higheſt and the loweſt, the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference and the Centre, A. and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Since then this Contemplation of the Paſſion is higher and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter then all others; I cannot but doubt that many are ſome wayes deluded, who aſpire to the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſole Contemplation of the Godhead, as to the more high and perfect: And that many more deceived in the ſame manner, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume thither though uncapable, ſuppoſing that true abſtraction, which yet is no more but a ſleepy demiſſion of Nature. And they reſt in their Manly ſpirit, where they ſhould reſt in the Divine.</p>
               <p>That therefore this holy Paſſion may be conſidered in this exerciſe, and drawn into practiſe, we muſt alwayes behold it joyntly with the Godhead, and the Godhead with it, by beholding alway before our eyes God crucified. For, as in the

And as in our practiſe, the Will of God is almoſt alway conjoyned with his Paſſion, inaſmuch as alway things adverſe to nature are to bee accepted and pleaſing rejected in the Active Life; So in this, God is almoſt alway conjoyned with his Croſſe, the ſame Rule of accepting and refuſing being ſtill to be follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed. And as in the Active Life this Divine Will, Paſſion or Croſſe and Affliction are one and the ſame thing; So God and his Croſſe are here alſo one. And as there we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Wil of God and Affliction or Croſſe without Multiplicity, ſo here we are alſo to ſee God and his Croſſe with one ſimple &amp; the ſame ſight. But, to determine preciſely and in particular when any one is
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:135667:132"/> fit for this exerciſe, and when for each part thereof, that is indeed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficult, I ſay not impoſſible, becauſe of the many interpoſſible events, which may take away, leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, or alter ſuch fitneſſe. For, firſt, tis conſiderable whether it be long time or ſhort ſince his Converſion.

And according to theſe Conditions and fitneſſes hee may enter upon theſe exerciſes, and paſſe along from one part to another. No o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeciall rule can be aſſigned.
